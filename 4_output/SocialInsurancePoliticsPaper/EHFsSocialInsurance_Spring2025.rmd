\begin{abstract}
\begin{singlespace} 

There is a long-standing claim that government social spending crowds out private savings and charity. There is also a newer set of arguments claiming that access to private resources (home equity, credit, or private charity) dampen voters' support for social insurance and redistributive spending. These claims have not been jointly investigated nor has the literature looked at workplace programs and benefits.  We investigate both sides of the ``substitution hypothesis'' in the context of a novel set of workplace private welfare programs: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs). EHFs enable employers to distribute emergency cash to their workers using donations pooled from employees themselves. Hundreds of major US firms now operate these programs. We use three original surveys, including survey experiments with workers at two specific employers with EHFs.  We find that state-level generosity in the social safety net is unrelated to worker support for or willingness to donate to EHFs. Experimental manipulation of EHF salience among workers at two large retailers indicates that EHFs do not displace support for public unemployment insurance or government emergency aid, regardless of the generosity of the EHF program.  EHFs and government social insurance programs appear unconnected in the minds of workers.\\

For centuries, pundits and scholars have debated whether government spending crowds out private savings and charity [@townsendDissertationPoorLaws1786; @friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002; @andreoniImpureAltruismDonations1990; @bredtmannDoesGovernmentSpending2023; @lehmann-hasemeyerDoesSocialSecurity2018].  More recently, scholars of comparative political economy have studied how "private welfare" and "self-insurance" undermine support for social insurance and redistribution [@ansellPoliticalEconomyOwnership2014; @wiedemannHowCreditMarkets2022; @ahlquistTakingCreditRedistribution2017; @prasadLandTooMuch2012; @busemeyerWelfareStatePrivate2020].  Almost entirely absent from these discussions are large firms, which have tremendous leeway to introduce, revise, and eliminate everything from employee health and life insurance coverage to retirement programs to transportation and childcare subsidies to charitable initiatives.  Does employer-based "private welfare" feed back into the political system, reducing support for government spending on these same activities?  Does government welfare effort affect worker interest in firm-driven private welfare and charitable programs? 

In this paper, we focus on one novel type of workplace program that combines *both* private welfare and charitable activities: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  These now-widespread programs---operating largely in the US---are set up by corporations as tax-exempt charities. Employers solicit donations from their own employees to fund cash grants to their workers during times of unexpected personal hardship.  EHFs are, in essence, a scaled up, tax-advantaged version of "passing the hat" for those in need, echoing the long tradition of worker mutual aid.  We use these programs to study both directions of the "substitution hypothesis."  EHFs are relatively new, discrete programs that vary across firms, making them tractable.  As a form of corporate charitable activity, we can examine whether worker interest in and donation to EHF programs varies as a function of government welfare effort.  As a form of private welfare, we can examine whether EHFs affect workers' support for government programs to aid the unemployed and those in need.  

We fielded three pre-registered surveys. In an original survey of US retail workers, we ask whether variation across US States in welfare effort predicts worker interest in and willingness to donate to EHFs. To study the effects of EHFs on workers, we fielded two original, independent surveys of workers at two large US retailers with long-standing EHF programs of widely differing generosity.  We manipulate worker awareness of their employer's EHF by randomly assigning some workers to watch  employer-produced or adapted testimonial videos from EHF grant recipients to study whether EHFs, as a form of private welfare, affect support for government programs aiding the unemployed and those in need.^[In a companion piece [@ahlquistPrivateWelfareCorporate2025], we study EHFs and their relationship to job attachment.  That paper draws on these same data to study different outcomes.  We avoid unnecessary duplication between papers but survey descriptions, case selection, and description of the experiments are nearly identical across the two papers.]  In the end, we find that our EHF treatments do *not* reduce support for government social insurance among workers at either firm, regardless of program generosity.  And even though our EHF treatment increases worker willingness to donate to the EHF, this effect is not moderated by state-level welfare generosity or individual-level considerations such as religiosity and partisanship. Using hierarchical models, we also find no detectable relationship between state-level welfare regimes and broader worker interest in EHF programs. Taken together, these findings suggest that  EHFs, as a workplace mutual aid arrangement, and government social insurance programs are unconnected in the minds of workers.  In short, we find no evidence consistent with either version of the substitution hypothesis. 

Our findings make five contributions.  First we highlight how workplace benefits have been excluded from broader debates about private welfare and the crowd out between government spending and private initiatives.  Second, we show how researchers can exploit variation in workplace benefits to speak to broader social science debates.  Third, we highlight EHFs as curious, understudied workplace programs.   Fourth, in the case of EHFs, we fail to uncover evidence that this workplace program connects meaningfully with political attitudes.  This lack of connection may be because EHFs are too new or too small to matter, but future research will be needed. Finally, there are policy stakes. EHFs connect to several areas of concern in the contemporary American political economy, including notable inequities across workers as well as increased employer leverage over workers in an era of monopsonistic local labor markets, weak unions, and strained safety nets.  For example,  EHFs, as with all workplace benefits, are conditional on employment with a specific firm, potentially exacerbating inequality across workers at different firms or in different sectors.  EHFs may also increase employer power over workers when they are most vulnerable, similar to the "welfare capitalism" of the past [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976; @jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998]. EHFs, as with many job-related benefits, lack formal mechanisms for worker input and accountability, beyond worker quits.  On the positive side, workers appear to value emergency aid and corporations may be more efficient at delivering immediate cash assistance than government, at least to families of the employed.

In the next section we go into both forms of the substitution hypothesis in more detail, highlighting the absence of any real consideration of workplace programs and benefits.  Section \@ref(sec-ehf-bkgrnd) provides the necessary background on EHFs and summarizes the main hypotheses we examine here.  Section \@ref(sec-genpop) decribes the research design and results for Study 1 while Section \@ref(sec-study2-3) describes the case selection, survey experiments, and results from Studies 2 and 3.  Section \@ref(sec-conclusion) concludes.

# The "substitution hypothesis," two ways {#sec-lit}

This paper builds on two largely disconnected literatures concerned with whether private resources and public welfare and social insurance substitute for one another.  The first literature stems from arguments emerging as far back as the 18th Century (at least), claiming that government spending on poor relief, welfare, and social insurance crowds out private charitable giving and private savings.  The second and more recent literature works in the opposite direction.  It focuses on the links between improved access to private financial resources---credit, appreciating assets, insurance---and reduced voter support for public welfare and social insurance programs.  Both of these versions of the substitution hypothesis bear some resemblance to the policy feedback literature, long a staple of American politics, in which "policies make politics" [@schattschneiderPoliticsPressureTarriff1935; @campbellPolicyMakesMass2012].  Nevertheless, the substitution hypothesis literatures we draw on are less concerned with how government policies create organized constituencies that reinforce or undermine that policy. Importantly, none of these various strands of thought has looked squarely at whether workplace benefits and charitable programs might relate to voter attitudes toward government welfare efforts. 

## Government spending crowds out of private savings and charity

Almost as soon as governments began systematically spending tax money in support of the poor, aged, and infirm, arguments emerged that such spending is actually counterproductive.^[@defoeGivingAlmsNo1893 is the first we could uncover in the British tradition.] The reasons given often had much to do with purported moral failings among the laboring classes, but political economy arguments eventually emerged. @townsendDissertationPoorLaws1786 may have been the first to articulate the claim that tax-funded social spending will depress *both* private savings and private charity.^[Townsend says "Let the same [generous, charitable] man be straitened in his circumstances, let him be burthened with taxes...and he will have little inclination to seek for objects of distress, or to visit the sequestered cottage of the silent sufferer...If, agreeable to the general practice of the labouring poor, a man...has made no provision for his future wants; if all, to whom he might naturally look for aid, are in the same circumstances with himself; and if the charity of those among his neighbours, who are distinguished for benevolence, nay of all who have the common feelings of humanity, is exhausted; if they who are most willing are least able to relieve him; we must expect to see distress and poverty even among those who are worthy of compassion."  @malthusEssayPrinciplePopulation1798 claims that "The poor laws of England may therefore be said to diminish both the power and the will to save among the common people" (Ch. 5).  @detocquevilleAlexisTocquevillesMemoir1997 created a distinction between "private" and "legal" charity, arguing that "any permanent, regular, administrative system whose aim will be to provide for the needs of the poor, will breed more miseries than it can cure, will deprave the population that it wants to help and comfort, will in time reduce the rich to being no more than the tenant-farmers of the poor, will dry up the sources of savings, will stop the accumulation of capital, will retard the development of trade, will benumb human industry and activity, and will culminate by bringing about a violent revolution in the State, when the number of those who receive alms will have become as large as those who give it, and the indigent, no longer being able to take from the impoverished rich the means of providing for his needs, will find it easier to plunder them of all their property at one stroke than to ask for their help."]

As the welfare state expanded dramatically in the post-War period, these arguments revived [@friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002], along with empirical scrutiny.  @feldsteinSocialSecurityInduced1974 argued that Social Security depressed household private savings by 30-50%, spawning an ongoing debate about the scale of substitution and its consequences [@alessiePensionWealthHousehold2013; @lehmann-hasemeyerDoesSocialSecurity2018].  Several theoretical models, based on the assumption that charities provide public goods, imply that government spending will crowd out private charity to some degree [@andreoniImpureAltruismDonations1990; @warrParetoOptimalRedistribution1982; @bergstromPrivateProvisionPublic1986].  Subsequent empirical work focused on determining whether government spending crowds out private giving dollar-for-dollar (as in models of "pure altruism") or at some lesser rate ("impure altruism").  A variety of empirical contexts and research designs produced widely varying estimates, including some evidence of "crowding in" [@dewitGovernmentSupportCharitable2016; @bredtmannDoesGovernmentSpending2023; @andreoniCharitableGiving2013].^[Crowding-in is most frequently observed in studies of government grants to specific charities, in which government support may signal need or charity quality, a line of reasoning irrelevant to this paper.  A more relevant possibility is that both government spending and private charity are signals (or byproducts) of broader cultural or institutional dispositions toward collective support [@dewitGovernmentExpendituresShift2018a].  Lab experimental studies tend to provide the largest estimates of crowding out.] The weight of evidence suggests that government spending *can* crowd out some proportion of charity and savings, but the scale is unclear and the details matter.    

Most relevant to this study, @hungermanAreChurchState2005a and @gruberFaithbasedCharityCrowdout2007 exploit variation in social support across US States (as we do below), estimating that government social welfare spending reduces charitable relief from churches by about 30%. @paarlbergPoliticsDonationsAre2019 lack an identification strategy, but find that counties with lower tax burdens and higher proportions of Republican voters also donate more to charity.  In some of the most well-identified studies, charitable organizations intervene between donations and service provision, complicating interpretation.  For example, fundraising effort responds strategically to government support [@andreoniCrowdingOutDue2011].  @panjwaniCausesConsequencesMedical2023 show that health-related crowdfunding campaigns (i.e., demand for charity) declined after expansions in medical insurance coverage due to the  Affordable Care Act.  @leeNewDigitalSafety2022 show that areas with poor private insurance coverage and fewer social associations see greater crowdfunding campaign initiation rates, but campaigns in these same areas are *less* likely to be successful (i.e., charitable capacity or norms might be weaker).  @bernardOutCrowdingEffects2025 show that crowdfunding projects with low excludability (i.e., you do not need to donate to enjoy benefits, should the project go forward) exhibit the most crowding out.  EHFs are non-excludable in this regard.    

In attempting to estimate the crowd out rate, existing empirical work frequently uses actual government social spending, as opposed to indicators of the spending "regime" [@esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990].  This is a problematic conflation for at least three reasons. First, spending levels at any point in time are endogenous to conditions that may also affect savings and charitable giving.^[There are several clever empirical strategies for addressing this, but they produce different estimates of crowd out from very different contexts [@boberg-fazlicDoesWelfareSpending2017; @hungermanAreChurchState2005a; @gruberFaithbasedCharityCrowdout2007; @andreoniGrantsCharitiesCrowd2014]]  Second, citizens' beliefs about government spending in specific areas are only weakly connected to actual spending levels (which fluctuates more than opinion) [@dewitHeterogeneityCrowdingoutWhen2017].  Voter knowledge about the level of government support directed to particular intermediary charities is even more meager [@horneCharitableDonorsKnow2005].  Howver voter beliefs about government spending levels are connected to their pre-existing partisan identities [@bullockPartisanBiasFactual2015; @mettlerSubmergedState2011].  @kleinteeselinkPartisanshipPoliticalAlignment2025 show that co-partisans of the US President reduce their charitable donations independently of any changes to the level and composition of actual spending, likely because they are more confident in the efficacy of government when their preferred party is in power.  Third, expectations about the adequacy of *future* spending should matter when forming opinions or making donations.  As such, the adequacy and credibility of social spending *regimes* would be more relevant than actual spending levels at any moment in time, as @esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990 noted decades ago.^["Expenditures are epiphenomenal to the theoretical substance of welfare states."  p.19].  We take this on in our measurement choices below.   

Firms are significant sources of charitable funding across a range of causes.  This funding can take the form of direct corporate donations to specific charities or even individuals.  But firms also actively organize their employees to donate their private resources, sometimes using matching or other incentives [@meierSubsidiesIncreaseCharitable2007]. Firms appear to give for different reasons than individuals [@brammerCorporateReputationPhilanthropy2005; @bertrandHallMirrorsCorporate2021], but workplace philanthropic fundraising is significant [@rimesGivingWorkExploring2019; @shakerGiveOfficeReview2019].  Political scientists have studied employer-organized political donations [@hertel-fernandezPoliticsWork2018; @stuckatzHowWorkplaceAffects2022], which do appear to partially crowd out other charitable contributions [@yildirimArePoliticalCharitable2024].  But, as yet, there is no work examining any link between the government safety net and workplace giving, especially when the beneficiaries of workplace charity are other workers.  We provide the first such test looking at EHF programs.

## Private resources crowd out support for a public safety net

A newer, smaller, and largely parallel literature has emerged, documenting how shocks to private resources affect voter support for public social programs.  Most obviously, governments sometimes step in when private resources are diminished.  @margalitExplainingSocialPolicy2013 uses panel data around the Great Recession to show that people who lose their job become more supportive of government support for the unemployed, but when the need disipates, so does their support for government unemployment insurance, especially among Republican voters.  As an historical matter, government administered, tax-funded unemployment insurance grew out of the repeated collapse (and ad hoc bailouts) of privately-organized welfare and mutual aid pools [@socialsecurityadministrationSocialSecurityHistory2023; @westernClassMarketPrinceton1997; @harrisSocialPolicyOther2018; @glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001].  

More attention has been paid to how improvements in private resources can crowd out support for government social insurance and welfare programs. The logic is simple: voters who perceive an improved financial position are more confident in their ability to "self-insure" against negative income shocks while also becoming less willing to pay taxes into the public system from which they perceive a reduced benefit.  Real estate (especially housing) is a key, politically relevant asset and source of savings [@ansellPoliticsHousing2019].  @ansellPoliticalEconomyOwnership2014 finds that American and British voters with appreciating real estate assets are less supportive of social insurance.  @wiedemannHowCreditMarkets2022 and @ahlquistTakingCreditRedistribution2017 focus on easy access to credit (related to home ownership and real estate prices) as a key private resource that can reduce pressure for redistributive policy and social spending.  Where real estate is more financialized (i.e., more tied to credit markets), home owners are less supportive of redistributive social policies [@andreHomeOwnershipSupport2016].  

Beyond housing and credit, economic risk and access to insurance has been a major area of interest.  Those able to "self-insure" through higher wealth and incomes are less worried about negative economic shocks and less supportive of government spending to help the unemployed, infirm, and aged [@rehmInsecureAlliancesRisk2012, @hackerInsecureAmericanEconomic2013]. @busemeyerWelfareStatePrivate2020 provide a theoretical account and empirical data illustrating how the presence of private insurance options reduces high-income voters' support for unemployment and pension spending.  Increasingly fine-grained data combined with growing income inequality increase the scope for private insurance options to emerge, weakening support for "solidaristic" government policies [@iversenBigDataWelfare2022].^[@hadziabdicPrivateSpannerPublic2022, using German panel data, finds no robust relationship between taking out life insurance and broad attitudes around social spending and government activity.]  
 
Private charity is also relevant here.  @werfelDoesCharitableGiving2018 uses survey experiments to manipulate beliefs about the degree of private charitable funding directed at specific needs.  In the area of social services, greater perceived charitable activity significantly reduced support among conservatives and moderates for government spending in that same area.

Again, however, there is a dearth of research that explores how variation in employer-provided amenities and insurance as well as corporate charitiable efforts affect voter attitudes and behavior.  This is remarkable, as there is considerable variation across firms and over time and space in workplace amenities as well as corporate charitable initiatives.  Insofar as EHFs are a form of private emergency aid, increased program awareness could blunt support for social insurance or government aid programs in times of emergency (e.g., COVID-19).  This paper seeks to determine whether we can observe this effect among US retail workers.

# Employee Hardship Funds {#sec-ehf-bkgrnd}
## Background

In the contemporary United States, unions are vanishing and the welfare and social insurance systems are creaking. Temporary and other "non-standard" employment relationships are increasingly widespread [@abrahamMeasuringGigEconomy2021; @weilFissuredWorkplace2014].  Yet such work arrangements fail to provide access to traditional social insurance and labor market protections [@thelenAmericanPrecariatCapitalism2019]. Americans in the lower half of the education and earnings distributions have seen years of stagnating wages while also bearing more economic risk [@hackerGreatRiskShift2019].

Against this backdrop, The Home Depot has maintained the Homer Fund since 1999 while Walmart started the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT) in 2001.^[ACNT has since renamed as the ACNT Together Fund.]  Both programs are set up as non-profit charities (501c(3)) offering cash grants for employees facing emergency expenses.  The Homer Fund makes grants of up to \$10,000 while the Walmart fund makes grants of up to \$1,500.  Beyond simple generosity, the programs differ in multiple ways, including application procedures and the frequency with which a worker can receive a grant.   Both funds solicit (tax deductible) donations from both corporate and front-line employees.  Grants to workers are tax-exempt under US law.

Both ACNT and the Homer Fund are examples of Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  By blending aspects of charities and private "welfare capitalism" EHFs belie the extraordinary leeway that employers have to introduce job amenities and programs that may both respond to and affect government policy.  Nevertheless, these programs have gone largely unstudied.  Outside of a small practitioner literature, there is very little accessible information about EHFs [@associationofdisasterrelieffundsandemployeehardshipfundsEnvironmentalScanDisaster2013; @employeerelieffundeducationgroupEnvironmentalScanDisaster2019;@aspeninstituteIlluminatingHiddenSafety2019; @rodriguezEmployeeHardshipFunds2020;@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020].^[@amorimScheduleUnpredictabilityHighCost2022; @reichWorkingRespectCommunity2018 are the only two peer-reviewed pieces mentioning EHFs of which I am aware.] There is no central database of EHFs, but we have positively documented over 320 companies across multiple industries and sectors operating EHFs as of January 2025. Nine of the ten top US retailers by revenue have maintained an EHF.  There is sufficient corporate interest in EHFs that a cottage industry in EHF management has developed.  Many employers now outsource the administration of their EHFs to third-party nonprofit agencies, the largest of which appears to be the Employee Assistance Foundation (EAF), which claims to have over 400 corporate clients.  EAF distributed over \$86 million in grants in 2020 according to IRS filings.

EHFs appear to be expanding.  Levi Strauss & Co. reported a three-fold increase in applications to their EHF in 2020 [@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020], with another spike in applications once coronavirus emergency aid programs expired in the US.  The Home Depot suspended fundraising from employees and expedited grant processing during the pandemic emergency. EAF reported a more than tenfold increase in grant applications relative to historical averages in the first two quarters of 2020 as well as 140 new client EHFs [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].   In May 2020 Amazon.com launched its EHF---using \$25 million in corporate money---in the face of extensive criticism of its workplace safety practices during the coronavirus outbreak as well as ongoing attempts to unionize its warehouse and fulfillment centers.  Amazon shuttered its EHF in August 2022.  

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-HfACNTcomps) zooms in on the Home Depot's Homer Fund and Walmart's ACNT using data from IRS 990 forms [@lecyNCCSIRS9902023; @suozzoProPublicaNonprofitExplorer2025].  In the left panel we report net assets for each firm's nonprofit foundations.^[For tax purposes, both Homer Fund and ACNT EHFs are part of the larger Home Depot and Walmart corporate foundations, respectively.]  Both corporate charities show strong growth from 2010, but Homer Fund is operating at more than double the ACNT's size.  The right panel looks at grants to domestic individuals, my preferred indicator of EHF activity.^[The larger foundations typically focus on disbursing grants to other nonprofit and community organizations, as opposed to individuals.  The Homer Fund website reports disbursing \$17 million in 2023 EHF grants whereas the Home Depot foundation 2023 IRS form 990 reports \$19.1 million in grants to individuals.]  Homer Fund is making \$15-25 million in annual grants between 2008 and 2022 whereas ACNT typically disburses less than \$10 million, notwithstanding Walmart's much larger corporate presence.  Homer Fund reports making a total of over \$267 million in grants to more than 183,000 individuals over its existence. ACNT claims to have disbursed over \$142 million over its existence to over 145,000 workers.

The examples above illustrate how EHFs vary across firms in virtually all programmatic aspects including longevity, eligibility requirements, application procedures, grant generosity and frequency, funding structure, and even whether they are managed in-house or out-sourced to third parties. Although all EHFs have a mutual aid component, communication around the programs varies in tone and intensity.  The Home Depot aggressively promote its EHF through dedicated social media and YouTube channels as well as regular donation drives.  Walmart appears to put substantially less effort into promoting their program. Across firms, EHF messaging varies, sometimes emphasizing charitable motivations, sometimes emphasizing solidarity with co-workers, and sometimes framing the EHF as more of a job amenity.

## Hypotheses 

EHFs combine charitable and solidaristic motivations with job amenities and the appearance of social insurance.  Workers are both asked to donate to these funds while hearing that their employer intends to help in times of unexpected hardship. Moreover, the structure and generosity of these programs varies significantly across employers. Connecting EHFs to both forms of the substitution hypothesis is straight forward.  If the substitution hypothesis holds, we expect workers in places with stronger government safety nets to be less interested in and less willing to donate to EHFs.  Existing work suggests that political conservatives may be more attentitve to these ostensible trade-offs. In the US, there is considerable variation across states in the generosity of unemployment and welfare benefits as well as in the administrative burdens workers face in accessing benefits when needed.  We exploit this cross-state variation below.  

In the other direction, workers exposed to information about their employer's EHFs will be less supportive of government programs to support people in times of hardship, as their employer is now intervening.  The more generous the EHF, the less a worker may perceive a need for public programs.   

We collect these hypotheses in Table \@ref(tab:tab-hypotheses) for ease of reference.

# Study 1 {#sec-genpop}

In Study 1 we explore hypotheses 1 and 1a.  We fielded an original survey of US retail workers with questions probing their knowledge and experience with EHFs, including whether their current employer has one and their level of support for these programs.  We focus on a single industry to hold fixed cross-industry variation. Retail is attractive as it is employs over 15 million Americans, with that number growing in the last decade.  Retail work is also known for lower wages and levels of human capital development along with  unpredictable scheduling, suggesting that retail workers might value EHF-style benefits or insurance.

We fielded the survey using the Cloud Research incentivized panel, targeting US respondents 18+ employed in retail.  The survey was in the field from February 12 - 22, 2025 and produced `r nrow(genpop)` valid responses.^[Of those targeted, only respondents with US IP addresses, who passed a screening question confirming employment in the retail industry, and who successfully passed two different attention check questions were allowed to complete the survey.  Respondents with duplicate IP addresses reporting identical demographic values were also excluded.]  Using the 2024 American Community Survey-reported demographics for US adults working in retail, we constructed post-stratification weights based on gender, race, and education. Descriptive statistics about the sample appear in Appendix \@ref(app-genpop-survsum).    

## Research design

In the US, virtually all social safety net and labor market benefits are managed at the state level.^[Social Security, Medicare, and veterans' benefits are the primary programs that are run directly by the federal government.]  Consequently, there is significant variation across states in both the generosity of the social safety net and the ease of accessing the benefits that are available [@herdAdministrativeBurdenPolicymaking2019; @foxEffectAdministrativeBurden2023]. For example, in normal economic times, most states offer up to 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, with some states offering as little as 12 while Montana provides 28.  The main cash welfare program, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), provides a maximum monthly benefit of \$915 in New Hampshire but only \$162 in Arkansas for a single parent of one child of in 2023 [@falkTemporaryAssistanceNeedy2024].

In Study 1, we examine whether state-level safety net generosity is a meaningful predictor of EHF support and donation intentions.  We rely on cross-state variation in the robustness of their social safety nets to look at two specific outcomes: the degree of support for an EHF at the respondent's current retail employer and the stated willingness to donate to the EHF.  Both outcomes are ordered categorical variables.^[Outcome categories for the donation question were \{nothing at all, one time donation less than $20, one time donation more than $20, regular donation of less than $20, regular donation of more than $20\}.]  Question wording varied slightly based on whether a respondent reported an employer with an EHF.^[We were not in a position to verify whether respondent reports were accurate, so this represents perceptions only.]  We therefore condition on whether the respondent claims to have an EHF.

In measuring variation in the state-level safety net, we rely on the simulated benefit levels produced by @schmidtStateSafetyNet2024.  In our main specifications, we use the "state directed" portion of these benefits, to better isolate differences across states.^[Our findings do not hinge on this decision.  Using the "cash and food" benefits estimates in @schmidtStateSafetyNet2024 or the measure of TANF benefit generosity from @foxEffectAdministrativeBurden2023 produce similar results.  Measure of UI generosity, including maximum weeks of benefits and average weekly benefit amounts also show no relationship with EHF support or donation.] 

## Results

Figure \@()  displays the distributions of both EHF outcomes against our measure of safety net generosity.  Inspection of the graphs suggests that there is no relationship between saftey net generosity and either support for and EHF or willingness to donate.

We explore these relationships further using both linear regression and hierarchical linear models allowing for random intercepts as well as cross-state variation in the effect of political conservatism, both as a function of state-level safety net generosity. In addition to state safety net variables, we also include a variety of other covariates connected to charitable giving propensity and the substitution hypothesis.  These include whether the respondent has used welfare in the past, religiosity, and whether the respondent identifies as politically conservative [@brooksWhoReallyCares2006; @bekkersWhoGivesLiterature2011; @wiepkingWhoGivesLiterature2012; @andreoniCharitableGiving2013].^[describe religiosity and conservative variables]. Because appreciating real estate assets may depress support for the welfare state, we produce a measure of home price increases.  Specifically, we multiply an indicator for home ownership with the 5-year change in the state-level home price index produced by the US Federal Housing Finance Agency.  We also condition and race, gender, age, education, and household income.

# Studies 2 & 3 {#sec-study2-3}
## Case selection

Studies 2 and 3 focus on workers at two "big box" US retailers with well-established EHF programs, The Home Depot and Walmart.  These firms compete to some degree in both product and labor markets.  By looking at two large firms in the same industry, we can hold industry considerations constant.  We focus on these two firms for X reasons.  First, they are both extremely large employers , making our independent survey recruitment strategy feasible (more below).  Second, by concentrating on two specific firms I can conduct survey-based experiments tailored to specific EHF programs.  Third, both firms have in-house EHFs of similar vintage. Fourth, the Home Depot and Walmart EHFs differ markedly in both their generosity and in the level of worker engagement, allowing us to compare findings across contexts to see whether program differences matter.  We briefly outline the two programs. 

The Home Depot's EHF---The Homer Fund---is managed in-house and has been in continuous operation since 1999.  The Homer Fund is among the most generous EHFs, with a maximum grant amount of \$10,000 per event, eligibility from the first day of employment, and the ability to apply repeatedly (conditional on a new qualifying event).  The Homer Fund is sizable, reporting disbursements of \$21.2 million to over 12,000 workers in the 2022 fiscal year [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023], the year of the survey.  Importantly, the Home Depot aggressively promotes the Homer Fund to encourage worker engagement, especially donations.  The Homer Fund has a dedicated website and YouTube channel with numerous professional-quality testimonial videos, along with active social media accounts aimed at workers.  The Home Depot runs regular Homer Fund donation drives in which different stores compete with one another. 

As with the Homer Fund, Walmart's ACNT Together Fund is over 20 years old and managed in-house.  The EHF is available to both full- and part-time workers who have been at Walmart for at least 90 days. But the ACNT is substantially less generous than the Homer Fund, with a maximum grant of \$1500 in a rolling 5-year period, regardless of how many qualifying events occur. The ACNT Together Fund has minimal presence on social media and there is no evidence of any donation drives or promotional efforts similar to those at the Home Depot.  Interestingly, Walmart matches employee donations to the Walmart political action committee 2:1 with corporate donations to the Together Fund.^[In 2015, the Federal Election Commission rejected a challenge to this practice.  In our sample, fewer than 1% of respondents reported making a contribution to the Walmart PAC.]    

## The samples and surveys

To independently construct matched worker-employer survey samples, we recruit participants using ads on the Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads) targeted at users 18 and older with Meta-reported status as Home Depot and Walmart employees, respectively [@schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019].  Those completing the survey were offered entry into a raffle for a free iPad Mini or Visa gift card.  @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 show that this strategy has considerable promise, producing accurate estimates of the employee population in the retail industry.  But the social media recruitment strategy has the obvious drawback of potentially biased sample selection.  Selection concerns are unavoidable to some degree,  but @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 demonstrate that this strategy can still recover good estimates of known firm-level quantities.  As we are interested in treatment effects in out sample, we do not use any survey weights in the analysis.

Survey recruitment for the Home Depot sample occurred between 7 September and 15 October 2021.  In the end, 515 individuals completed the survey, passed an attention check, and confirmed their Home Depot employment status.  The Walmart survey was in the field from October 23 to December 4, 2024 and produced `r nrow(wmt.hq)` complete responses that passed similar screening and attention checks.  Summary statistics for all variables by treatment condition appear in Appendices \@ref(app-survsum-uw), \@ref(app-survsum-w), and \@ref(app-wmt-survsum).

The surveys in Studies 2 and 3 were very similar in question wording and ordering, but Study 3 had several extensions to Study 2, including a behavioral measure of donation to the EHF (clicking on a link to a donation page). Study 3 also included an expanded the EHF survey experiment that included a placebo video condition.

## EHF survey experiments

In both studies 2 and 3, we randomly exposed respondents to messages about their employer's EHF to test HX and XX.  The main quantities of interest are the average treatment effects (ATE) for each of the EHF treatments relative to control for each of the outcome variables.  We present graphical displays as well as regression-based estimates.  

Importantly, we are randomly assigning informational videos, not program access or benefits.  Some workers arrive in the survey with prior exposure to information about their employer's EHF.  These "pre-exposed" may be less responsive to the treatment messages than those unaware of the EHF prior to the survey.^[I will use the terms "aware" and "pre-exposed" interchangeably.]  To the extent we are interested in the effect of informing a previously uniformed worker about the EHF, the ATEs could be subject to "pre-exposure bias" [@druckmanLearningMorePolitical2012a; @ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023]. We therefore consider heterogeneity in treatment effects based on pre-exposure to the EHF.

We measure respondent prior awareness of their employer's EHF by presenting them with a list of job amenities and asking them to select all of the ones they have access to. We code a positive response to "emergency cash to help in times of need" as indicating awareness of the EHF program.^[See @ahlquistPrivateWelfareCorporate2025 for a detailed discussion of this measurement stategy and comparison with other measures of EHF awareness in the survey.]  We ask this question of all respondents several items before they encounter the experimental treatment.  The assumption needed to sustain a causal interpretation of the treatment is that pre-exposure to information about the EHF is independent of potential outcomes, conditional on treatment and relevant pre-treatment covariates.^[Pre-exposure can also be viewed through the lens of compliance with treatment assignment; the pre-exposed are "always takers" while the un-exposed are "compliers".  Since we have direct measures of pre-exposure, however, the heterogeneous effects approach is more natural.]
 
In the analysis that follows, we report four models for each outcome.  The first includes only the experimental treatment indicators, providing ATE estimates.  The second adds a treatment-by-awareness interaction term.  The third includes a suite of pre-registered pre-treatment covariates.^[These are age, gender, race, college degree status, tenure at their job, whether this job is their primary job, and whether they work full-time. @ahlquistPrivateWelfareCorporate2025 shows that job tenure and full-time status are the primary predictors of pre-exposure to the EHF.] The fourth, "expanded" model then adds additional covariates that were not pre-registered but that are relevant to the substitution hypothesis literatures.  The set of expanded covariates includes household income, whether the respondent identifies as politically conservative,  a measure of religiosity, our measure of home value appreciation, and the saftey net generosity in the respondent's state of residence.  Following the pre-registered plan, we report linear regression models in the main text, employing robust or clustered standard errors, as appropriate.  Models employing different distributional assumptions appear in the appendix.


### Study 2

The experiment in Study 2 consisted of a control condition and two treatment arms, referred to as the _text_ and _video_ treatments, respectively.  Respondents in the control arm saw no prompt or mention of the Home Depot EHF.  Those in the text treatment saw a brief, neutral statement describing their employer's EHF.^[The prompt was "Your employer, The Home Depot, maintains a program called the Homer Fund.   The Homer Fund combines donations from workers like you with money from The Home Depot corporation.  The Homer Fund uses this money to offer cash grants of up to \$10,000 to Home Depot employees in times of unexpected financial hardship like a natural disaster, illness, or death in the family."]  

Neutral textual descriptions do not reflect how employers actually communicate with their employees.  Fortunately, the Home Depot maintains a YouTube channel that includes high-quality video testimonials from purported Homer Fund grant recipients. Study 2 respondents in the video treatment were asked to watch the video displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (a).^[The video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe) and here: [https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story](https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story).  The summary text appearing on the Home Depot website is: "When Ray, a retired Army veteran and proud Home Depot associate, fell severely ill, his family needed help covering expenses such as food and gas. With the help the Homer Fund and his fellow associates’ generosity, he and his family were able to recover. The Homer Fund, a nonprofit exclusively for Home Depot associates, celebrates 20 years of giving in 2019. Established by our co-founders Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank and Ken Langone, it has awarded $176 million to more than 138,000 Home Depot families facing unforeseen hardships. For Ray and his family, The Fund’s help came at a critical time. Ray spent six weeks in an induced coma. The Homer Fund stepped in to help his family secure necessities so they could focus their energy on Ray’s recovery. The Fund’s impact on Ray’s family reminded him of the comradery of his Army days. 'You know you have a brother and sister to your left or to your right. And you look out for them and they look out for you,' Ray says."  This text was not presented to survey respondents, but is presented here to provide a summary of video contents.  The video was 2:41 in length.]   

Our key outcomes of interest in Study 2 comes from a battery of questions asking respondents to report how much responsibility the government should have for ensuring the welfare of different groups, with responses in four categories ranging from "none at all" to "a lot".  Here we examine responses for "the unemployed".  This question format, taken from the General Social Survey, is also part of the ISSP "role of government" module and is widely used for gauging attitudes toward government social insurance and welfare activities [@blekesaunePublicAttitudesWelfare2003;@beanComparisonMassAttitudes1998; @rehmInsecureAlliancesRisk2012; @deemingPoliticsFracturedSolidarity2018].  We will interpret responses to this question as reflecting support for government-provided unemployment insurance (UI).

  )
)
```


#### Attitudes toward social insurance

The left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ui) displays the distribution of responses by EHF treatment status for Study 2. Overall, workers in the Home Depot sample are quite favorable toward government support for the unemployed, with a solid majority viewing the government as at least somewhat responsible for the welfare of the unemployed.  The video treatment clearly *reduces* the proportion of responses in the "none" category in favor of the two positive categories.  In other words, treatment made respondents *more* rather than less supportive of government-provided social insurance, contrary to the substitution hypothesis.  The text treatment, on the other hand, does not appear to have any detectable treatment effect on average.

```{r fig-ui, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Government responsibility for supporting the unemployed, by EHF treatment status.  Vertical bars are 95% confidence intervals.", fig.subcap = c("Study 1", "Study 2"), out.width="50%", fig.align = "center"}

  )
)

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '9_ui_models.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

```

In Table \@ref(tab:tab-ui), we display estimates from a series of linear regression models on UI support.  The first model, including only experimental treatments, confirms a positive average treatment effect for the video treatment of about `r round(coef(ui_lm_uw)[3]/sd(THD_comp_uw$gov_ui_num,na.rm=T),2)` standard deviations.  Looking at the second model that accounts for pre-exposure, we find that respondents pre-exposed to the Home Depot EHF are `r round(coef(ui_lm_int_uw)[4]/sd(THD_comp_uw$gov_ui_num,na.rm=T), 2)` standard deviations less supportive of UI than the unaware ($p<0.1$), but we find no treatment effects among the unaware.  Contrary to the substitution hypothesis, we do find positive treatment effects among the _pre-exposed_, especially for the video treatment.  Adding pre-registered covariates, including those that predict EHF pre-exposure (the third model), does not meaningfully alter interpretation.  The final model in Table \@ref(tab:tab-ui) includes a whole series of predictors connected to the substitution hypothesis, entered as linear terms.^[There was no evidence that the the treatment effect was moderated by state-level welfare generosity or respondent conservativeness.]  Unsurprisingly, more conservative respondents are less supportive of government support for the unemployed.  Income, past use of welfare benefits, religiosity, and increased home values are all unrelated to support for UI.  But those living in state with more generous safety nets are also more positive about government support for the unemployed, even after conditioning on conservativeness, suggesting that unemployment insurance and the broader safety net are connected in respondents' minds.

```{r tab-ui,eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Support for UI regression models" }
#temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '9_ui_models.R')
#source(temp)
#rm(temp)
ui_tab

```

To interpret the heterogeneous treatment effects more easily, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uieff) displays treatment effects by respondent pre-exposure to the EHF, derived from the second model.  In the case of support for the unemployed, we see that treatment effects are entirely concentrated among those _already_ aware of the Home Depot's EHF.  Contrary to expectations, both the text and video treatments _increase_ support for UI, although only the latter is a significant effect by conventional standards.  This finding deserves more exploration, but it consistent with author interviews with EHF professionals in which they indicate that EHFs are meant to supplement or provide a bridge to public benefits, rather than supplant them.   

```{r fig-uieff, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interpreting treatment effects from UI models"}
ui_eff_plot

```

Is unemployment support the appropriate policy to link with the EHF?  After all, the EHF is designed to provide benefits while having a job with this employer whereas UI is designed to help when a job is lost.^[The pre-exposed may better appreciate this distinction, which may help explain the unexpected findings.]  There are two pieces of evidence that UI is a reasonable policy domain to link with EHF benefits.  First, although a worker who loses her job is no longer eligible for EHF benefits from that employer, workers are often eligible for EHF grants when an immediate family member loses their job.  Second, the UI question was asked as part of a battery of questions asking about UI was well as two other policy areas: government support for the elderly and the provision of childcare for working parents.  These two questions can constitute "placebos" since EHFs have no connection with either policy area.  Parameter estimates from regressing support for these alternative policy areas on the EHF treatments and EHF awareness appear in Appendix Table \@ref(tab:tab-placebo).  There is no evidence for any relationship between the EHF treatments and support for government involvement in either elder support or childcare, regardless of whether the respondent was aware of the EHF going into the survey and adjusting for predictors of awareness as well as predictors relevant to the substitution hypothesis.

In Study 2, we did see some evidence that those pre-exposed to the EHF reacted to treatment differently than the unexposed, consistent with H2a, but the effects observed were not in the expected direction under H2.  We see no evidence consistent with the hypothesis that employer-provided "private welfare" crowds out support for the social saftey net.  If anything, the EHF treatment increases support for government action to support the unemployed.

### Study 3 

The survey experiment for the Study 3 is similar to that from Study 2. We pre-registered a plan to examine whether treatment effects differ based on pre-exposure to the ACNT, measured using the same question format as in Study 2.  Nevertheless, we modified the Home Depot experiment for Study 3.  First, based on weak performance of the text treatment from the Home Depot,  we use only video vignettes for the Walmart sample, omitting the text treatment.  Unfortunately, Walmart does not produce video or other testimonials about the ACNT.  To construct a comparable treatment for the Walmart sample, we produced an original video using the Homer Fund treatment as both script and audio-visual template.  We adapted the video to the Walmart context and used a paid actor; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (b) displays a still image from the beginning of the video.^[The paid actor exhibited the same gender (male) and racial (white) expression as in the Homer Fund video.  The actor was also viewed as approximately the same age as the spokesperson in the Homer Fund video, according to mTurk coders. The ACNT-adapted video was 41 seconds shorter than the Homer Fund video.  We achieved this by shortening or removing some interstitial and panning shots, not through any reduction in the spoken script beyond those parts that were only relevant to the Home Depot.] 

Second, to address concerns that findings from Study 2 might be a "video effect", as opposed the effect of messages about the EHF, Study 3 includes a placebo arm.  Respondents in the placebo condition watched a video in which the same hired actor reads a Walmart press release about the company's acquisition of Vizio.^[Videos can be seen here: [placebo video](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-placebo); [treatment (solidarity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHFStudy3-solidarity); [treatment (charity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-charity).]  In Study 3, respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to either treatment or control.  Within the control condition, respondents were randomly divided between the pure control and the placebo.  The pure controls saw no additional information, just as in Study 2.^[As part of Study 3, we pre-registered a sub-experiment in which we randomly vary the initial framing of the treatment video.  Specifically, the "card" visible on the screen before the respondent clicks "play" differs, with the _solidarity_ framing displaying text emphasizing supporting other Walmart workers and the and the _charity_ framing displaying text emphasizing charitable donations to help those in need. The content of the video vignette was otherwise identical across treatment groups; see previous footnote for links to both versions of the treatment video.  There were no detectable differences between the two different framings of the treatment video, so we do not report on this in the main text.  Regression results demonstrating this for key outcomes appears in Appendix \@ref(app-framing).]  Manipulation checks (see Appendix \@ref(app-manip-wmt)) confirm that the video treatment did indeed increase respondent awareness of the ACNT, as expected, whereas the placebo had no effect.   Thus we display results for binary treatment/control in the analysis below.   

Third, we modified the outcomes we study in two ways.  In the Walmart survey we again used the GSS question battery and asked respondents about the level of responsibility the government has for ensuring living standards for various social groups.  As in Study 2, the survey in Study 3 asks about the elderly and the unemployed.  To more closely link outcome measurement with EHFs in Study 3, we substituted a question asking about government responsibility for "people confronting short-term hardships" for the childcare question in Study 2.  We also created a behavioral indicator of donation willingness to the Walmart EHF.  At the end of Study 3, respondents had the opportunity to click on a link to take them to a page where they could donate to the ACNT. Based on past research, we expect those exposed to the emotional appeal in the video to be more willing to donate [@andreoniPowerAskingHow2011; @bekkersLiteratureReviewEmpirical2011].  We will examine whether the generosity of the state safety net moderates this treatment effect.

#### Attitudes toward social insurance and emergency government aid

The right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ui) displays the Study 3 response distribution for the unemployment support outcome while the left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:fig-emerg-donate) displays the response distribution for the emergency aid outcome.  Over 80% of the Walmart sample agreed that the government should take at least some responsibility for the living standards of the unemployed, a much higher rate than among the Home Depot workers. The Walmart sample exhibited a similar level of support for government aid to those facing hardship.  Among the Walmart sample, there is no treatment effect apparent for either outcome.  Nevertheless, the pattern of responses for UI for Walmart is similar to Study 2: those in the treatment group were less likely to say that the government has no responsibility for the unemployed, contrary to the substitution hypothesis.           
  
```{r fig-emerg-donate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Additional Walmart outcomes, by EHF treatment status.  Vertical bars are 95% confidence intervals.", out.width="50%", fig.subcap = c("emergency aid", "ACNT donation"), fig.align = "center"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '14_donate_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

knitr::include_graphics( c(
  here('4_output', 'plots','emerg_plot_wmt.png'),
  here('4_output', 'plots','donate_wmt.png')
  )
)
```


Table \@ref(tab:tab-ui-hard-wmt) displays regression results that reinforce the null relationship in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-ui) and \@ref(fig:fig-emerg-donate).  There is no evidence of a treatment effect for either outcome. Pre-exposure to the ACNT and additional covariated make no difference in this conclusion.  In the "expanded" model we continue to see that conservatives are less supportive of government activity to support the unemployed and those facing temporary hardship.  Walmart workers who have seen their home values appreciate are less supportive of UI but there is no relationship between home appreciation and support for government aid to those facing temporary hardship.  More religious respondents are significantly less supportive of aid to those in temporary need.  The generosity of the State-level safety net has no connection to respondents attitudes for either outcome.      

```{r tab-ui-hard-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Treatment effect on support for unionization (Walmart)", results='asis'}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '13_ui_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

ui_hard_tab_wmt
```

Walmart has a substantially less generous EHF than the Home Depot.  Given the findings in Studies 1 and 2, the null findings in Study 3 are unsurprising.  Exposing Walmart workers to videos about their employers' EHF had no effect on their attitudes toward unemployment benefits or government emergency aid, although Walmart workers were, overall, much more supportive of these programs.  

#### Willingness to donate to the Walmart EHF

Study 3 included an opportunity to click a link to donate to the ACNT.  As the right panel in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-emerg-donate) shows, there is a low baseline willingness to take this action of `r round(100*donation_summary$prop[1])`% in the Walmart sample.  Nevertheless, those seeing the EHF video were about 4 percentage points (or 35\%, $p < 0.05$) more likely to take an action to donate. 

```{r tab-donate-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="ACNT donation willingness (Walmart sample)", results = 'asis'}
donation_tab_wmt
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab-donate-wmt) presents regression-based estimates of treatment effects, using linear probability models.^[See \@ref(app-wmt-altdonate) for estimates using logistic regression and Firth regression to address concerns with rare events.  Estimated treatement effects are quite similar across models.] Treatment significantly increases willingness to take an action to donate.  There is no evidence that either state-level generosity or ACNT pre-exposure moderates these treatment effects.^[Hierarchical logit models including state-level random effects and random slopes produce the same conclusion.]  The inclusion of addiational covariates does nothing to alter these conclusions.

The ACNT treatment did significantly increase willingness to donate, as expected, indicating that the treatment did work. But there is  no evidence to support the claim that welfare generosity has any effect on the willingness of workers to donate to an EHF program.  Across all three studies, we see no evidence consistent with either H1 or H2.

# Discussion and Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

There is a significant scholarly tradition arguing about whether private resources and charitable activities are substitutes for public welfare and social insurance.  These literatures have virtually ignored the workplace, even though employers have tremendous leeway to introduce or modify benefit plans and workplace programs that address a variety of economic risks. EHFs are one such tax-incentivized program that has received virtually no systematic study.  This oversight is all the more remarkable as EHFs clearly echo both an earlier era of welfare capitalism and past mutual aid initiatives that produced and modern labor unions.  Do these programs influence workers perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in ways consistent with the "substitution hypothesis"? 

In three pre-registered studies, our answer is a definitive "no."  In Study 1, we found no evidence that state-level welfare effort predicts support for or donation willingness to EHFs.  In Studies 2 and 3, using survey experiments, there was no evidence that EHFs reduce support for government unemployment benefits or emergency aid, regardless of the substantial differences in generosity across the Home Depot and Walmart programs.  In the Home Depot sample, the treatment induced a modest but significant _increase_ in support for government-provided UI, and outcome that may be the result of these workers having a better understanding of the EHF program (and its limitations).  In Study 3, the treatment effect on EHF donations did not vary by state welfare generosity, contrary to expectations.  Findings in these surveys are inconsistent with a simple "private options crowd out public benefits" story.  

The existing study is not designed to speak to mechanisms, but findings do point toward future research.  The lack of any substitution effect between EHFs and support for public assistance suggests that EHFs may represent a reconfiguration of the moral economy of low-wage work.  Strong worker interest in EHFs may reflect pessimism about the fraying safety net in the US.  Rather than a substitute for social insurance and assistance, EHFs may be low-cost signals of corporate values and selective benevolence.  Direct comparison between attitudes toward government- and employer-provided benefits would be instructive here. 

An alternative interpretation is that EHFs are simply too new, too uncertain, or too small to matter yet.  More probing, perhaps through interviews or analysis of online worker forums could shed light here.   EHFs also emerged in the US, where the social safety net is particularly weak, inequality is stark, and regional variation in ecomomic prospects continue to diverge.  Cross national research in worker interest in EHF-type programs might be instructive in this regard.

Finally, the literature has given limited attention to how knowledge and awareness of government programs affects private charitable behavior, despite theoretical reasons to expect that information constraints may moderate crowding out effects. This represents an important avenue for future research, particularly relevant to understanding how employee knowledge of government programs might affect participation in workplace charitable mechanisms.

Past generations of workers built organizations to help one another in hard times.  Some of these mutual aid societies eventually transformed into full-fledged trade unions.  Others morphed into mutual insurance companies that later informed government social insurance programs [@deswaanWorkersClientsMutualism1986].  Such organizations transformed workplace relations, socialized workers into political life, and produced labor-based political movements.

EHFs present a tractable, unexploited context to study important questions in the social sciences and management.  EHFs present a well-defined intervention for studying  whether "private governance" initiatives actually benefit workers themselves [@anderson_private_2017; @ahlquist_firm_2020; @locke_promise_2013; @malesky_chains_2018; @distelhorst_does_2017; ].      

I argue that EHFs are a blend of employer-driven welfare capitalism and worker mutual aid.  Drawing on interviews with executives and EHF managers, I expect EHFs to be closely connected to the corporate culture in which they are embedded, producing mixed and contingent effects on worker attitudes. Using three original, pre-registered studies, I present the first _systematic_ description of worker awareness and experience with EHFs as well as experimental evidence on the effect of corporate messaging around EHFs. I show that EHFs can build attachment to employers and coworkers when they are generous, well-promoted, and align with other corporate signals and management practices, but they do not affect workers' subjective financial security.

In study 1, I use a survey of US retail workers to describe retail workers' awareness of EHF programs among major employers, their level of interest in such programs, and their preferred influence over how the fund is run.  I find that awareness is limited and retail workers are not well-informed about which firms offer such programs.  Nevertheless, when weighed against other job amenities, emergency cash support is second only to paid time off in inducing workers to consider a hypothetical job offer at another retailer.  Respondents strongly support the creation of an EHF at their current employer and preferred a program in which workers themselves have meaningful influence over fund management.

In studies 2 and 3,  I focus on workers at two large retailers with long-standing EHF programs: the Home Depot and Walmart.  Both firms have EHFs that are over two decades old and managed in-house.   But the firms and programs differ in important ways.  The Home Depot EHF, the Homer Fund, is considerably more generous (with a maximum grant of \$10,000 against Walmart's \$1,500) and more heavily promoted among workers and executives.  IRS filing data indicates that the Homer Fund is also considerably larger than Walmart's EHF, even though Walmart is over three times the size of the Home Depot in US employee headcount.  Both firms also maintain strikingly different corporate cultures, with the Home Depot known for.^[According to the MIT Sloan Culture 500 rankings, based on analysis of Glassdoor postings, Walmart's]  

Using social media to manage the difficult task of recruiting a sample of workers linked to specific firms, I fielded original, independent surveys of Home Depot and Walmart workers. I find considerable differences in program awareness across employers.  Among Home Depot workers, awareness is "broad-but-thin": over 60% of Home Depot respondents displayed some awareness of the Homer Fund, but there were inconsistencies across measurement items, suggesting recognition but not real understanding. At Walmart, only 38% were aware of the program.  At both employers, tenure with the firm is the primary consistent predictor of EHF awareness and engagement.

In both studies 2 and 3, I use survey experiments to identify the impact of messages that raise EHF awareness.  Specifically, I exploit employer-produced promotional video messages about the EHF and look at effects on workers' subjective financial security, job attachment, and support for unionization and government-provided social insurance. In the Walmart survey I look at additional outcomes, including willingness to click on a link to donate to the EHF and perceptions about co-workers' support for unionization. 

In Study 2, Home Depot workers who were already aware of the Homer Fund prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, less supportive of unions, and less supportive of unemployment benefits, even after adjusting for job tenure.  The video treatment produced an average increase in job attachment of about 0.6 standard deviations on the relevant scale.  On average, the video treatment makes workers more _uncertain_ about unionization.  Further decomposing treatment effects, I find that the Homer Fund video treatment effects were largely concentrated among respondents _unaware_ of the EHF prior to my survey. Among this group, the video treatment significantly reduced support for unionization while increasing uncertainty (as opposed to outright opposition).

In Study 3, I find both similarities and differences with Study 2.  As in the Home Depot sample, Walmart workers who were already aware of their EHF prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, and less supportive of unions, even after adjusting for job tenure.  For the experiment in Study 3, I construct a custom video vignette that reproduced the Homer Fund video for the Walmart context.  The video treatment again produced no detectable effect on perceived financial stability.  But, contrary to findings in the Home Depot sample, I find no evidence of a treatment effect on job attachment, including quit intentions.  The video treatment did produce a four percentage point increase in the likelihood a respondent takes an action to donate.  The video treatment reduces opposition to unionization and increases (by four percentage points) the percent of coworkers expected to vote for unionization.   In contrast to the Home Depot sample, the Walmart sample showed no evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects based on prior knowledge of the Walmart EHF, known as the Associates in Critical Need Trust Together Fund (ACNT).

From a policy perspective, EHFs appear to resonate with a felt need among low-wage retail workers in the US today.  But, as the Home Depot and Walmart surveys indicate, program details, context, and promotion matter for the effects they might have on the workforce.  These programs operate in the shadow of eroded public welfare institutions, yet they are funded in part by favorable tax treatment.  Are the benefits these programs provide worth the tax expenditures?  How do these programs change when workers themselves have a voice in how they are run? 

Workers value emergency aid arrangements, which coincides with the renewed emphasis on mutual aid--and other solidaristic selective incentives--as a basis for rebuilding worker solidarity [@hertel-fernandezWhyPublicSector2021;@jarleyUnionsSocialCapital2005; @horowitzMutualismBuildingNext2021].  The development, management, and outreach around programs like EHFs provide a clear point of common interest between workers, unions, and management.  To date this possibility remains unexplored.


nor do they displace support for public benefits.


EHFs present a fascinating window into employer behavior and the state of the low wage labor market in the US and beyond. Future research can extend in a variety of productive directions.  


and more supportive of unemployment insurance

There is no detectable treatment effect on attitudes towards government programs in support of the unemployed or those facing hardship.


@hadziabdicPrivateSpannerPublic2022

EHF may be viewed as "private insurance", which could dampen support for social insurance. Prompting workers with information about their employer's EHF will reduce workers' willingness to vote for unionization and reduce stated support for government aid programs for unemployment or emergencies.


@fishbackSocialInsurancePublic2020

 attitudes, or beliefs about the welfare state?
 
 Some EHFs appear to be the result of spontaneous initiatives from executives, often in response to a major natural disaster affecting a region closely connected to the firm and its employees.^[Disaster aid and social insurance are closely linked in the US [@landisFateResponsibilityNatural1999].]  Based on interviews, this often stemmed from frustration with the slow and uneven government aid. 

Even before COVID-19, there was plenty of evidence that the existing social insurance and welfare systems were stigmatizing, encumbered with numerous "administrative burdens" [@herdAdministrativeBurdenPolicymaking2019], and straining to deliver to those in need.  Several informants suggested that EHFs may present a private, partial complement to a weakening or slow public system.  By locating mutual aid programs in the firm, program participation might be higher and the EHF can benefit from corporate resources.  Applying for an EHF grant may be easier or less stigmatizing than applying for government assistance and the turn around time for benefits could be much faster in times of acute need.^[The Home Depot claims that grants are processed within 7 business days of application receipt, far faster than welfare or unemployment benefits, which also require waiting periods in many states.]
