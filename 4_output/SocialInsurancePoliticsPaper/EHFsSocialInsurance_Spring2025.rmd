\begin{abstract}
\begin{singlespace} 

There is a long-standing claim that social insurance and public welfare spending crowd out private savings and charity. There is also a newer set of arguments claiming that access to private resources (home equity, credit, or existing charitable activity) dampen voters' support for public insurance programs and redistributive taxation. These claims have not been jointly investigated nor has the literature looked at workplace programs and benefits.  We investigate both sides of the "substitution hypothesis" in the context of a novel set of workplace private welfare programs--Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs). EHFs enable employers to distribute emergency cash to their workers using donations pooled from employees themselves. Hundreds of major US firms now operate these programs. We use three original surveys, including survey experiments with workers at two specific employers with EHFs.  We find that state-level generosity in the social safety net is unrelated to worker support for EHFs. Experimental manipulation of EHF salience among workers at two large retailers indicates that EHFs do not displace support for public unemployment insurance or government emergency aid, regardless of the generosity of the EHF program. [Something about political ideology]. EHFs, as a workplace mutual aid arrangement, and government social insurance programs appear unconnected in the minds of workers.\\

For centuries, pundits and scholars have debated whether government spending crowds out private savings and charity [@townsendDissertationPoorLaws1786; @friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002; @andreoniImpureAltruismDonations1990; @bredtmannDoesGovernmentSpending2023; @lehmann-hasemeyerDoesSocialSecurity2018].  More recently, scholars of comparative political economy have studied how "private welfare" and "self-insurance" undermine support for social insurance and redistribution [@ansell_political_2014; @wiedemann_how_2022; @ahlquistTakingCreditRedistribution2017; @prasadLandTooMuch2012; @busemeyer_welfare_2020].  Almost entirely absent from these discussions are large firms, which have tremendous leeway to introduce, revise, and eliminate everything from employee health and life insurance coverage to pensions and subsidized savings to transportation and childcare to corporate charitable initiatives.  Does employer-based "private welfare" feed back into the political system, reducing support for government spending on these same activities?  Does government welfare effort affect worker interest in firm-driven private welfare and charitable programs? 

In this paper, we focus on one novel type of workplace program that combines *both* private welfare and charitable activities: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  These now-widespread programs---operating largely in the US---are set up by corporations as tax-exempt charities. Employers solicit donations from their own employees to fund cash grants to their workers during times of unexpected personal hardship.  EHFs are, in essence, a scaled up, tax-advantaged version of "passing the hat" for those in need, echoing the long tradition of worker mutual aid.  We use these programs to study both directions of the "substitution hypothesis."  As a form of corporate charitable activity, we can examine whether worker interest in and donation to EHF programs varies as a function of government welfare effort.  As a form of private welfare, we can examine whether EHFs affect workers' support for government programs to aid the unemployed and those in need.  

Specifically, we fielded three pre-registered surveys. In an original survey of US retail workers, we ask whether variation across US States in welfare effort predicts worker interest in and willingness to donate to EHFs. To study the effects of EHFs on workers, we fielded two original surveys of workers at two large US retailers with long-standing EHF programs of widely differing generosity.  We manipulate worker awareness of their employer's EHF by randomly assigning some workers to watch  employer-produced or adapted testimonial videos from EHF grant recipients to study whether EHFs, as a form of private welfare, affect support for government programs aiding the unemployed and those in need.^[In a companion piece [@ahlquistPrivateWelfareCorporate2025], we study EHFs and their relationship to job attachment.  Although that paper draws on these same data to study different outcomes, we avoid unnecessary duplication between papers.  Survey descriptions, case selection, and description of the experiments are nearly identical across the two papers.]  In the end, we find that our EHF treatments do *not* reduce support for government social insurance among workers at either firm, regardless of program generosity.  And even though our EHF treatment increases worker willingness to donate to the EHF, this effect is not moderated by state-level welfare generosity or individual-level considerations such as religiosity and partisanship. Using hierarchical models, we also find no detectable relationship between state-level welfare regimes and broader worker interest in EHF programs. Taken together, these findings suggest that  EHFs, as a workplace mutual aid arrangement, and government social insurance programs are unconnected in the minds of workers.  We find no evidence consistent with either version of the substitution hypothesis. 

Our findings make XXX main contributions.  First we highlight how workplace benefits have been excluded from broader debates about private welfare and the crowd out between government spending and private initiatives.  Second, we show how researchers can expoilt variation in workplace benefits to speak to broader social science debates.  Third, we highlight EHFs as curious, understudied workplace programs.   Fourth, in the case of EHFs, there does not appear to be a spillover from workplace programs to political activity.  This may be because EHFs are too new or too small to matter, but future research will be needed. Finally, there are policy stakes. EHFs connect to several areas of concern in the contemporary American political economy, including notable inequities across workers as well as increased employer leverage over workers in an era of weak unions and strained safety nets.  For example,  EHFs, as with all workplace benefits, are conditional on employment with a specific firm, potentially exacerbating inequality across workers at different firms or in different sectors.  EHFs may also increase employer power over workers when they are most vulnerable, similar to the "welfare capitalism" of the past [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976; @jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998]. EHFs, as with many job-related benefits, also lack formal mechanisms for accountability, beyond worker quits.  On the positive side, workers appear to value emergency aid and corporations may be more efficient means to deliver immediate help than government (although this does not help the unemployed).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  The next section goes into the substitution hypothesis and related literature in more detail, highlighting the absence of corporate programs as a significant lacuna.  The following section provides the necessary background on EHFs and summarizes the main hypotheses we examine here.  Section XX describes the research design


# The "substitution hypothesis," two ways

This paper builds on two literatures that are largely disconnected both of which are concerned with whether private resources and public welfare and social insurance substitute for one another.^[@hadziabdicPrivateSpannerPublic2022 is a recent exception.]  The first literature stems for arguments emerging as far back as the 18th Century (at least), claiming that government spending on poor relief, welfare, and social insurance crowds out private charitable giving and private savings.  The second and more recent literature works in the opposite direction.  It focuses on the links between improved access to private financial resources---credit, appreciating assets, insurance---and reduced voter support for public welfare and social insurance programs.  Both of these versions of the substitution hypothesis bear some resemblance to the policy feedback literature---long a staple of American politics---in which "policies make politics" [@schattschneiderPoliticsPressureTarriff1935; @campbellPolicyMakesMass2012].  Nevertheless, the substitution hypothesis literatures we draw on here are far less concerned with how government policies create organized constituecies that then reinforce or undermine that policy. Importantly, none of these various strands of thought has looked squarely at whether workplace benefits and charitable programs might relate to voter potential attitudes toward government welfare efforts. 

## Government spending crowds out of private savings and charity

Almost as soon as governments began systematically spending tax money in support of the poor, aged, and infirm, arguments emerged that such spending is actually counterproductive.^[@defoeGivingAlmsNo1893 is the first we could uncover in the British tradition.] The reasons given often had much to do with purported moral failings among the laboring classes, but political economy arguments eventually emerged. @townsendDissertationPoorLaws1786 may have been the first to articulate the claim that tax-funded social spending will depress *both* private savings and private charity.^["Let the same [generous, charitable] man be straitened in his circumstances, let him be burthened with taxes...and he will have little inclination to seek for objects of distress, or to visit the sequestered cottage of the silent sufferer...If, agreeable to the general practice of the labouring poor, a man...has made no provision for his future wants; if all, to whom he might naturally look for aid, are in the same circumstances with himself; and if the charity of those among his neighbours, who are distinguished for benevolence, nay of all who have the common feelings of humanity, is exhausted; if they who are most willing are least able to relieve him; we must expect to see distress and poverty even among those who are worthy of compassion."  @malthusEssayPrinciplePopulation1798 claims that "The poor laws of England may therefore be said to diminish both the power and the will to save among the common people" (Ch. 5).  @detocquevilleAlexisTocquevillesMemoir1997 created a distinction between "private" and "legal" charity, arguing that "any permanent, regular, administrative system whose aim will be to provide for the needs of the poor, will breed more miseries than it can cure, will deprave the population that it wants to help and comfort, will in time reduce the rich to being no more than the tenant-farmers of the poor, will dry up the sources of savings, will stop the accumulation of capital, will retard the development of trade, will benumb human industry and activity, and will culminate by bringing about a violent revolution in the State, when the number of those who receive alms will have become as large as those who give it, and the indigent, no longer being able to take from the impoverished rich the means of providing for his needs, will find it easier to plunder them of all their property at one stroke than to ask for their help."]

As the welfare state expanded dramatically in the post-War period, these arguments revived [@friedmanCapitalismFreedom2002], along with empirical scrutiny.  @feldsteinSocialSecurityInduced1974 argued that Social Security depressed household private savings by 30-50%, spawning an ongoing debate about the scale of substitution and its consequences [@alessiePensionWealthHousehold2013; @lehmann-hasemeyerDoesSocialSecurity2018].  Several theoretical models, based on the assumption that charities provide public goods, imply that government spending will crowd out private charity to some degree [@andreoniImpureAltruismDonations1990; @warrParetoOptimalRedistribution1982; @bergstromPrivateProvisionPublic1986].  Subsequent empirical work focused on determining whether government spending crowds out private giving dollar-for-dollar (as in models of "pure altruism") or at some lesser rate ("impure altruism").  A variety of empirical contexts and research designs produced widely varying estimates, including some evidence of "crowding in" [@dewitGovernmentSupportCharitable2016; @bredtmannDoesGovernmentSpending2023; @andreoniCharitableGiving2013].^[Crowding-in is particularly frequent in studies of government grants to specific charities, which may signal need or charity quality, a line of reasoning irrelevant to this paper.  A more relevant possibility is that both government spending and private charity are signals (or byproducts) of broader cultural or institutional dispositions toward collective support [@dewitGovernmentExpendituresShift2018a].  Lab experimental studies tend to provide the largest estimates of crowding out.] The weight of evidence suggests that government spending *can* crowd out some proportion of charity and savings, but the scale is unclear and the details matter.    

Most relevant to this study, @hungermanAreChurchState2005a and @gruberFaithbasedCharityCrowdout2007 exploit variation in social support across US States (as we do below), estimating that government social welfare spending reduces charitable relief from churches by about 30%. @paarlbergPoliticsDonationsAre2019 lack an identification strategy, but find that counties with lower tax burdens and higher proportions of Republican voters also donate more to charity.  In some of the most well-identified studies, charitable organizations intervene between donations and service provision, complicating interpretation.  For example, fundraising effort responds strategically to government support [@andreoniCrowdingOutDue2011].  @panjwaniCausesConsequencesMedical2023 show that health-related crowdfunding campaigns (i.e., demand for charity) declined after expansions in medical insurance coverage due to the  Affordable Care Act.  @leeNewDigitalSafety2022 show that areas with poor private insurance coverage and fewer social associations see greater crowdfunding campaign initiation rates, but campaigns in these same areas are *less* likely to be successful (i.e., charitable capacity or norms might be weaker).  @bernardOutCrowdingEffects2025 show that crowdfunding projects with low excludability (i.e., you do not need to donate to enjoy benefits, should the project go forward) exhibit the most crowding out.  EHFs are non-excludable in this regard.    

In attempting to estimate the crowd out rate, existing empirical work frequently uses actual government social spending, as opposed to indicators of the spending "regime" [@esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990].  This is a problematic conflation for at least three reasons. First, spending levels at any point in time are endogenous to conditions that may also affect savings and charitable giving.^[There are several clever empirical strategies for addressing this, but they produce different estimates of crowd out from very different contexts [@boberg-fazlicDoesWelfareSpending2017; @hungermanAreChurchState2005a; @gruberFaithbasedCharityCrowdout2007; @andreoniGrantsCharitiesCrowd2014]].  Second, there are major, systematic errors in citizens' beliefs about government spending in specific areas.  Beliefs are only weakly connected to actual spending (which fluctuates more than opinion) [@dewitHeterogeneityCrowdingoutWhen2017].  Voters' knowledge about the amount of government support directed to particular intermediary charities is even more meager [@horneCharitableDonorsKnow2005].  But beliefs about spending levels are connected to voters' pre-existing political commitments [@bullockPartisanBiasFactual2015; @mettlerSubmergedState2011].  @kleinteeselinkPartisanshipPoliticalAlignment2025 show that co-partisans of the US President reduce their charitable donations independently of any changes to the level and composition of actual spending, likely because they are more confident in the efficacy of government when their preferred party is in power.  Third, expectations about *future* spending (and its adequacy) should matter when forming opinions or making donations.  As such, the adequacy and credibility of social spending *regimes* would be more relevant than actual spending levels, as @esping-andersenThreeWorldsWelfare1990 noted decades ago.^["Expenditures are epiphenomenal to the theoretical substance of welfare states."  p.19].  This is reflected in our measurement choices below.   

Firms provide significant source of charitable funding across a range of causes.  This funding can take the form of direct donations from the corporate entity.  But firms also actively organize their employees to donate their private resources, sometime through matching or other incentives [@meierSubsidiesIncreaseCharitable2007]. Firms appear to give for different reasons than individuals [@brammerCorporateReputationPhilanthropy2005; @bertrandHallMirrorsCorporate2021], but workplace philanthropic is significant [@rimesGivingWorkExploring2019; @shakerGiveOfficeReview2019].  Political scientists have studied employer-organized political donations [@hertel-fernandezPoliticsWork2018; @stuckatzHowWorkplaceAffects2022], which do appear to partially crowd out other charitable contributions [@yildirimArePoliticalCharitable2024].  But, as yet, there is no work examining any link between the government safety net and workplace giving, especially when the beneficiaries of workplace charity are other workers.  We provide the first such test looking at EHF programs.

## Private resources crowd out support for a public safety net

A newer, smaller, and largely parallel literature has emerged, documenting how shocks to private resources affect voter support for public social programs.  Most obviously, government often steps in when private resources are diminished.  Government take over of funding for unemployment insurance grew out of the repeated collapse (and ad hoc bailouts) of privately-organized welfare and mutual aid pools [@socialsecurityadministrationSocialSecurityHistory2023; @western_1997].  @harrisSocialPolicyOther2018 argues that a similar dynamic occurred in 19th Century Britain, as friendly societies' financial positions became increasingly precarious. @glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001 argues for a similar dynamic in the US.  @margalitExplainingSocialPolicy2013 uses panel data around the Great Recession to show that people who lose their job become more supportive of government support for the unemployed, but when the need disipates, so does their support for government unemployment insurance, especially among Republican voters.

More attention has been paid to how improvements in private resources can crowd out support for government social insurance and welfare programs. The logic is simple: voters who perceive an improved personal financial position are more confident in their ability to "self-insure" against negative income shocks while also becoming less willing to pay taxes into the public system from which they perceive a reduced need for benefits.  Real estate (especially housing) is a key, politically relevant asset and source of savings [@ansellPoliticsHousing2019].  @ansell_political_2014 finds that American and British voters with appreciating real estate assets are less supportive of social insurance.  @wiedemann_how_2022 and @ahlquistTakingCreditRedistribution2017 focus on easy access to credit (related to home ownership and real estate prices) as a key private resource that can reduce pressure for redistributive policy and social spending.  Where real estate is more financialized (i.e., more tied to credit markets), home owners are much less supportive of redistributive social policies [@andreHomeOwnershipSupport2016].  

Beyond housing and credit, economic risk and access to insurance has been a major area of interest.  Those able to "self-insure" through higher wealth and incomes are less worried about negative economic shocks and less supportive of government spending to help the unemployed, infirm, and aged [@rehmInsecureAlliancesRisk2012, @hackerInsecureAmericanEconomic2013]. @busemeyer_welfare_2020 provide a theoretical account and empirical data illustrating how the presence of private insurance options reduces high-income voters' support for unemployment and pension spending.  Increasingly fine-grained data combined with growing income inequality increase the scope for private insurance options to emerge, weakening support for "solidaristic" government policies [@iversenBigDataWelfare2022].^[@hadziabdicPrivateSpannerPublic2022, using German panel data, finds no robust relationship between taking out life insurance and broad attitudes around social spending and government activity.    
 
Private charity is also relevant here.  @werfelDoesCharitableGiving2018 uses survey experiments to manipulate beliefs about the degree of private charitable funding directed at specific needs.  In the area of social services, greater perceived charitable activity significantly reduced support among conservatives and moderates for government spending in that same area.

Again much less work on improved benefits through work and effect on support for public policy.  Insofar as EHFs are a form of private emergency aid, increased program awareness could blunt support for social insurance or government aid programs in times of emergency (e.g., COVID-19).  This paper seeks to determine whether we can observe this effect among workers exposed to EHF information.



# Employee Hardship Funds {#sec-ehf-bkgrnd}
## Background

In the contemporary United States, unions are vanishing and the welfare and social insurance systems are creaking. Temporary and other "non-standard" employment relationships are increasingly widespread [@abraham_measuring_2018; @weilFissuredWorkplace2014].  Yet such work arrangements fail to provide access to traditional social insurance and labor market protections [@thelen_american_2019]. Americans in the lower half of the education and earnings distributions have seen years of stagnating wages while also bearing more economic risk [@hacker_great_2019].

Against this backdrop, The Home Depot has maintained the Homer Fund since 1999 while Walmart started the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT) in 2001.^[ACNT has since renamed as the ACNT Together Fund.]  Both programs are set up as non-profit charities (501c(3)) offering cash grants for employees facing emergency expenses.  The Homer Fund makes grants of up to \$10,000 while the Walmart fund makes grants of up to \$1,500.  Beyond simple generosity, the programs differ in multiple ways, including application procedures and the frequency with which a worker can receive a grant.   Both funds solicit (tax deductible) donations from both corporate and front-line employees.  Grants to workers are tax-exempt under US law.

Both ACNT and the Homer Fund are examples of Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  Outside of a small practitioner literature, there is very little accessible information about these programs [@associationofdisasterrelieffundsandemployeehardshipfundsEnvironmentalScanDisaster2013; @employeerelieffundeducationgroupEnvironmentalScanDisaster2019;@aspeninstituteIlluminatingHiddenSafety2019; @rodriguezEmployeeHardshipFunds2020;@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020].^[@amorimScheduleUnpredictabilityHighCost2022; @reichWorkingRespectCommunity2018 are the only two peer-reviewed pieces mentioning EHFs of which I am aware.] There is no central database of EHFs, but we have positively documented over 320 companies across multiple industries and sectors operating EHFs as of January 2025. Nine of the ten top US retailers by revenue have maintained an EHF.  EHFs appear to be expanding.  Levi Strauss & Co. reported a three-fold increase in applications to their EHF in 2020 [@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020], with another spike in applications once coronavirus emergency aid programs expired in the US.  The Home Depot suspended fundraising from employees and expedited grant processing during the pandemic emergency. EAF reported a more than tenfold increase in grant applications relative to historical averages in the first two quarters of 2020 as well as 140 new client EHFs [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].   In May 2020 Amazon.com launched its EHF---using \$25 million in corporate money---in the face of extensive criticism of its workplace safety practices during the coronavirus outbreak as well as ongoing attempts to unionize its warehouse and fulfillment centers.  Amazon shuttered its EHF in August 2022.  

There is sufficient corporate interest in EHFs that a cottage industry in EHF management has developed.  Many employers now outsource the administration of their EHFs to third-party nonprofit agencies, the largest of which appears to be the Employee Assistance Foundation (EAF), which claims to have over 400 corporate clients and distributed over \$86 million in grants in 2020 according to IRS filings.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-HfACNTcomps) zooms in on the Home Depot's Homer Fund and Walmart's ACNT using data from IRS 990 forms [@lecyNCCSIRS9902023; @suozzoProPublicaNonprofitExplorer2025].  In the left panel we report net assets for each firm's nonprofit foundations.^[For tax purposes, both Homer Fund and ACNT EHFs are part of the larger Home Depot and Walmart corporate foundations, respectively.]  Both corporate charities show strong growth from 2010, but Homer Fund is operating at more than double the ACNT's size.  The right panel looks at grants to domestic individuals, my preferred indicator of EHF activity.^[The larger foundations typically focus on disbursing grants to other nonprofit and community organizations, as opposed to individuals.  The Homer Fund website reports disbursing \$17 million in 2023 EHF grants whereas the Home Depot foundation 2023 IRS form 990 reports \$19.1 million in grants to individuals.]  Homer Fund is making \$15-25 million in annual grants between 2008 and 2022 whereas ACNT typically disburses less than \$10 million, notwithstanding Walmart's much larger corporate presence.  Homer Fund reports making a total of over \$267 million in grants to more than 183,000 individuals over its existence. ACNT claims to have disbursed over \$142 million over its existence to over 145,000 workers.

The examples above illustrate how EHFs vary across firms in virtually all programmatic aspects including longevity, eligibility requirements, application procedures, grant generosity and frequency, funding structure, and even whether they are managed in-house or out-sourced to third parties. Although all EHFs have a mutual aid component, communication around the programs varies in tone and intensity.  The Home Depot aggressively promote its EHF through dedicated social media and YouTube channels as well as regular donation drives.  Walmart, appear to put substantially less effort into promoting their program. Across firms, EHF messaging varies, sometimes emphasizing charitable motivations, sometimes emphasizing solidarity with co-workers, and sometimes framing the EHF as more of a job amenity.



[background and relevance]

Even as unions and social protections atrophy, employers across the U.S. are sponsoring a new form of private welfare: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs). These tax-exempt programs , funded in part through donations raised from the workers themselves.  As such, they blend aspects of charities, private "welfare capitalism". EHFs belie the extraordinary leeway that employers have to introduce job amenitites and progams that.   Nevertheless, these programs have gone largely unstudied.






Policy feedback literature too. No work that actively studies how variation in employer-provided benefits might relate to political attitudes and activities.  This is shocking, given the    Simlarly, there is no work on whether government social spending affects support for workplace benefits ^[There is some work that looks at whether having workplace benefits like health insurance affects support for reforms such as the affordable care act. (cites) ] 


  

 

EHFs combine external chariable and solidaristic motivations with job amenities and the appearence of social insurance

"the ask"

Peer pressure matters, espeically at work.  Some firms will exert more pressure to give than others

# Study 1

fielded an original survey using the Cloud Research incentivized panel, targeting US respondents 18+ employed in retail. The survey was in the field from February 12 - 22, 2025 and produced `r nrow(genpop)` valid responses.^[Of those targeted, only respondents with US IP addresses, who passed a screening question confirming employment in the retail industry, and who successfully passed two different attention check questions were allowed to complete the survey.  Respondents with duplicate IP addresses reporting identical demographic values were also excluded.]  Using the 2024 American Community Survey-reported demographics for US adults working in retail, we constructed post-stratification weights based on gender, race, and education. All descriptive quantities below represent weighted calculations.  Descriptive statistics about the sample appear in Appendix \@ref(app-genpop-survsum).

# Studies 2 & 3
## Case selection

Studies 2 and 3 focus on workers at two "big box" US retailers with well-established EHF programs, The Home Depot and Walmart, respectively.  These firms compete to some degree in both product and labor markets and both have seen union activism. They are extremely large employers, which makes recruiting a survey sample feasible.   By concentrating on two specific firms I can address detailed questions about EHF awareness and engagement as well as conduct survey-based experiments tailored to specific programs.  The differences between their EHFs are potentially instructive about variation in EHF effects.   

The Home Depot's EHF---The Homer Fund---is managed in-house and has been in continuous operation since 1999.  The Homer Fund is among the most generous EHFs, with a maximum grant amount of \$10,000 per event, eligibility from the first day of employment, and the ability to apply repeatedly (conditional on a new qualifying event).  The Homer Fund is sizable, reporting disbursements of \$21.2 million to over 12,000 workers in the 2022 fiscal year [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023], the year of the survey.  Importantly, the Home Depot aggressively promotes the Homer Fund to encourage worker engagement, especially donations.  The Homer Fund has a dedicated website and YouTube channel with numerous professional-quality testimonial videos, along with active social media accounts aimed at workers.  The Home Depot runs regular Homer Fund donation drives in which different stores compete with one another.  The Homer Fund prides itself on worker participation, claiming that a "majority of contributions" come from associates.^[[https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0](https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0).  See Appendix \@ref(app-THD-suggcont) for Home Depot's menu of suggested donation rates to the Homer Fund by rank.]  

As with the Homer Fund, Walmart's ACNT Together Fund is over 20 years old and managed in-house.  The EHF is available to both full- and part-time workers who have been at Walmart for at least 90 days.^[Based on a retail industry monthly separation rate of 4% [@usbureauoflaborstatisticsJobOpeningLabor2025], I expect about 12% of new Walmart hires to leave before becoming eligible to apply for an ACNT grant.] But the ACNT is substantially less generous than the Homer Fund, with a maximum grant of \$1500 in a rolling 5-year period, regardless of how many qualifying events occur. The ACNT Together Fund has minimal presence on social media and there is no evidence of any donation drives or promotional efforts similar to those at the Home Depot.  Interestingly, Walmart matches employee donations to the Walmart political action committee 2:1 with corporate donations to the Together Fund.^[In 2015, the Federal Election Commission rejected a challenge to this practice.  In our sample, fewer than 1% of respondents reported making a contribution to the Walmart PAC.]    

## The samples and survey

To independently construct matched worker-employer survey samples, I follow @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 and recruit participants using ads on the Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads) targeted at users 18 and older with Meta-reported status as Home Depot and Walmart employees, respectively.  Those completing the survey were offered entry into a raffle for a free iPad Mini or Visa gift card.  @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 show that this strategy has considerable promise, producing accurate estimates of the employee population in the retail industry.  But the social media recruitment strategy has the obvious drawback of potentially biased sample selection.  Although selection concerns are unavoidable to some degree,  I follow @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 and construct raking weights using the Facebook-reported gender and age distributions for Facebook/Instagram users who report employment at the Home Depot and Walmart, respectively.  @growFacebookAdvertisingDataforthcoming show that Facebook-reported age and gender appear quite accurate. I use raking weights when reporting descriptive quantities, but unweighted data when analyzing the survey experiment.

Survey recruitment for the Home Depot sample occurred between 7 September and 15 October 2021.  In the end, 515 individuals completed the survey, passed an attention check, and confirmed their Home Depot employment status.  The Walmart survey was in the field from October 23 to December 4, 2024 and produced `r nrow(wmt.hq)` complete responses that passed similar screening and attention checks.  Summary statistics for all variables by treatment condition appear in Appendices \@ref(app-survsum-uw), \@ref(app-survsum-w), and \@ref(app-wmt-survsum).

The surveys in Studies 2 and 3 were very similar in question wording and ordering, but Study 3 had several extensions to Study 2, including a behavioral measure of donation to the EHF (clicking on a link to a donation page). In Study 3 I expanded the EHF survey experiment by including a placebo condition.

### Survey experiments

## EHF experiments

In both studies 2 and 3, I included experiments that randomly exposed respondents to messages about their employer's EHF to test HX and XX.

The main quantities of interest are the average treatment effects (ATE) for each of the EHF treatments relative to control for each of the outcome variables.  I present graphical displays as well as regression-based estimates.  But we are randomly assigning informational videos, not program access or benefits.  Some workers arrive in the survey with prior exposure to information about their EHF.  These "pre-exposed" may be less responsive to the treatment messages than those unaware of the EHF prior to the survey.^[I will use the terms "aware" and "pre-exposed" interchangeably.]  To the extent we are interested in the effect of informing a previously uniformed worker about the EHF, the ATEs could be subject to "pre-exposure bias" [@druckmanLearningMorePolitical2012a; @ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023].  I therefore also consider heterogeneity in treatment effects based on pre-exposure to the EHF.

Using the approach described above, I measure EHF awareness before encountering the treatment.  The assumption needed to sustain a causal interpretation of the treatment is that pre-exposure to information about the EHF is independent of potential outcomes, conditional on treatment and relevant pre-treatment covariates.^[Pre-exposure can also be viewed through the lens of compliance with treatment assignment; the pre-exposed are "always takers" while the un-exposed are "compliers".  Since we have direct measures of pre-exposure, however, the heterogeneous effects approach is more natural.]
 For outcome $j$, the relevant heterogeneous effects can be estimated using the following approach: 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y_{ij}] = f(\alpha + \beta_1 T_i + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 T_iP_i + \beta_4 X_i)
(\#eq:reg)
\end{equation}
where $T_i$ and denote treatment condition and $P_i$ denotes whether $i$ is coded as pre-exposed to her employer's EHF. If $f(x) = x$, then we can estimate \@ref(eq:reg) using OLS, in which case $\beta_1$ is the "average information effect" [@ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023], i.e., the effects of the treatments among those who were previously unexposed.  The quantity $(\beta_1+\beta_3)$ represent the treatment effect among those who were aware of the EHF prior to the survey experiment. In the analysis that follows, I report three models for each outcome: one that includes only the experimental treatment indicators, providing ATE estimates; one that adds a treatment-by-awareness interaction term, and a third that also includes a suite of pre-treatment covariates.^[Full reporting of the covariate coefficient estimates appears in Appendix \@ref(app-cov)]

One might object that the measurement of EHF awareness is itself a form of priming or pre-exposure in the survey. There are two reasons why this is not a serious concern here.  First, the elicitation of EHF awareness is subtle, embedded in longer list of potential job benefits, and avoids using the program's name.  The risk of actual priming is low.  Second, if there were a meaningful priming effect from the EHF awareness question, we would expect to see minimal differences between the aware and un-aware.  This is not what we observe below. The pre-exposed Study 2 respondents are systematically different in terms of mean outcome levels and treatment effects from the un-exposed.  Third, to the extent that there is a priming or contamination from the EHF awareness question, it would reduce any detectable treatment effects or differences between the aware and unaware respondents. Thus my estimates are, if anything, downward biased and my conclusions are conservative.

### Study 2 experiment

The experiment in Study 2 consisted of a control condition and two treatment arms, referred to as the _text_ and _video_ treatments, respectively.  Respondents in the control arm saw no prompt or mention of the EHF.  Those in the text treatment saw a brief, neutral statement describing their employer's EHF.^[The prompt was "Your employer, The Home Depot, maintains a program called the Homer Fund.   The Homer Fund combines donations from workers like you with money from The Home Depot corporation.  The Homer Fund uses this money to offer cash grants of up to \$10,000 to Home Depot employees in times of unexpected financial hardship like a natural disaster, illness, or death in the family."]  

Neutral textual descriptions do not reflect how employers actually communicate with their employees.  Fortunately, the Home Depot maintains a YouTube channel that includes high-quality video testimonials from purported Homer Fund grant recipients. Study 2 respondents in the video treatment were asked to watch the video displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (a).^[The video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe) and here: [https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story](https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story).  The summary text appearing on the Home Depot website is: "When Ray, a retired Army veteran and proud Home Depot associate, fell severely ill, his family needed help covering expenses such as food and gas. With the help the Homer Fund and his fellow associates’ generosity, he and his family were able to recover. The Homer Fund, a nonprofit exclusively for Home Depot associates, celebrates 20 years of giving in 2019. Established by our co-founders Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank and Ken Langone, it has awarded $176 million to more than 138,000 Home Depot families facing unforeseen hardships. For Ray and his family, The Fund’s help came at a critical time. Ray spent six weeks in an induced coma. The Homer Fund stepped in to help his family secure necessities so they could focus their energy on Ray’s recovery. The Fund’s impact on Ray’s family reminded him of the comradery of his Army days. 'You know you have a brother and sister to your left or to your right. And you look out for them and they look out for you,' Ray says."  This text was not presented to survey respondents, but is presented here to provide a summary of video contents.  The video was 2:41 in length.]   Later in the survey respondents answered a battery of questions taken from the General Social Survey.  asks respondents to report how much responsibility the government should have for ensuring the welfare of different constituencies.  Here I examine responses for "the unemployed" (4-category response ranging from "none at all" to "a lot").  This is a commonly used question for gauging attitudes toward government social insurance in general [find cites].

  )
)
```



#### Attitudes toward government social insurance

Overall, workers in the Home Depot sample are quite supportive of unemployment insurance, with a solid majority viewing the government as at least somewhat responsible for the welfare of the unemployed.  We see that the video treatment substantially reduces the proportion of responses in the "none" category in favor of the two positive categories.  The EHF video treatment made respondents *more* rather than less supportive of government-provided social insurance, contrary to the substitution hypothesis.  The text treatment, on the other hand, does not appear to have any detectable treatment effect on average.

```{r tab-ui,eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Support for UI regression models" }
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '9_ui_models.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
ui_tab

```

Table \@ref(tab:tab-ui) displays regression estimates for UI support.  Results here confirm a positive average treatment effect for the video treatment of about `r round(coef(ui_lm_uw)[3]/sd(THD_comp_uw$gov_ui_num,na.rm=T),2)` standard deviations.  We see no large or statistically discernible difference between the pre-exposed and unaware in average support for UI.  We also see no treatment effects among the unaware, although there are treatment effects among the _pre-exposed_, especially for the video treatment.

To interpret this more easily, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uieff) displays treatment effects by respondent pre-exposure to the EHF.  In the case of UI, we see that treatment effects are entirely concentrated among those _already_ aware of the Home Depot's EHF.  Contrary to expectations, both the text and video treatments _increase_ support for UI, although only the latter is a significant effect by conventional standards.  This finding deserves more exploration, but it consistent with author interviews with EHF professionals in which they indicate that EHFs are meant to supplement or provide a bridge to public benefits, rather than supplant them.   

```{r fig-uieff, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interpreting treatment effects from UI models"}
ui_eff_plot

```

Is unemployment insurance the appropriate policy to link with the EHF?  After all, the EHF is designed to provide benefits while having a job with this employer whereas UI is designed to help when a job is lost.^[The pre-exposed may better appreciate this distinction, which may help explain the unexpected findings.]  There are two pieces of evidence that UI is a reasonable policy domain to link with EHF benefits.  First, although EHF benefits are not available to someone who loses her job with an employer, benefits are often available when a worker's immediate family member loses a job.  Second, the UI question was asked as part of a battery of questions asking about UI was well as two other policy areas: pensions for the elderly and the provision of childcare for working parents.  These two questions can constitute "placebos" since EHFs have no connection with either policy area.  Parameter estimates from regressing support for these alternative policy areas on the EHF treatments and EHF awareness appear in Appendix Table \@ref(tab:tab-placebo).  I find no evidence for any relationship between the EHF treatments and support for government involvement in either old age pensions or childcare, regardless of whether the respondent was aware of the EHF going into the survey.

Finally, we look at social insurance policies.  In the Walmart survey we again asked respondents the level of responsibility the government has for the elderly and the unemployed.  To further directly examine the substitution hypothesis, I also asked respondents about government responsibility for "people confronting short-term hardships."  As Table \@ref(tab:tab-ui-hard-wmt) displays, we find no evidence of any treatment effect for any of these policy areas among Walmart workers; pre-exposure to the ACNT makes no difference in this conclusion.  Across both the Home Depot and Walmart surveys, we see no evidence that "private welfare" in the form of EHFs has any negative effect on support for government-directed social support, whether for childcare, the unemployed, the elderly, or those experiencing sudden hardship.

```{r tab-ui-hard-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Treatment effect on support for unionization (Walmart)"}

ui_hard_tab_wmt
```


Findings related to the "substitution hypothesis"--the claim that private benefits and resources reduce support for government-provided programs--were another area of agreement across Studies 2 and 3.  Specifically, the video treatment shows no evidence of a negative effect on respondent support for government unemployment insurance or aid to those in temporary hardship.  In the Home Depot sample, the treatment induced a modest but significant _increase_ in support for government-provided UI.  This outcome may be the result of Home Depot workers having a better understanding of the EHF program (and its limitations).  Findings in these surveys are inconsistent with a simple "private options crowd out public benefits" story.

### Study 3 experiment 

Based on results from the Home Depot survey, Study 3 concentrates on a video vignette treatment for the Walmart sample, omitting the text treatment.  Unfortunately, Walmart does not produce video or other testimonials about the ACNT.  To construct a comparable treatment for the Walmart sample, We produced an original video using the Homer Fund treatment as both script and audio-visual template.  We adapted the video to the Walmart context and used a paid actor; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (b) displays a still image from the beginning of the video.^[The paid actor exhibited the same gender (male) and racial (white) expression as in the Homer Fund video.  The actor was also viewed as approximately the same age as the spokesperson in the Homer Fund video, according to mTurk coders. The ACNT-adapted video was 41 seconds shorter than the Homer Fund video.  We achieved this by shortening or removing some interstitial and panning shots, not through any reduction in the spoken script beyond those parts that were only relevant to the Home Depot.] To address concerns that findings from Study 2 might be a "video effect", as opposed the effect of an EHF message, Study 3 includes a placebo arm.  Respondents in the placebo condition watched a video in which the same hired actor reads a Walmart press release about the company's acquisition of Vizio.^[Videos can be seen here: [placebo video](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-placebo); [treatment (solidarity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHFStudy3-solidarity); [treatment (charity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-charity).]    

In Study 3, respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to either treatment or control.  Within the control condition, respondents were randomly divided between the pure control and the placebo.  The pure controls saw no additional information, just as in Study 2.^[As part of Study 3, I pre-registered a sub-experiment in which I randomly vary the initial framing of the treatment video.  Specifically, the "card" visible on the screen before the respondent clicks "play" differs, with the _solidarity_ framing displaying text emphasizing supporting other Walmart workers and the and the _charity_ framing displaying text emphasizing charitable donations to help those in need. The content of the video vignette was otherwise identical across treatment groups; see previous footnote for links to both versions of the treatment video.  There were no detectable differences between the two different framings of the treatment video, so I do not report on this in the main text.  Regression results demonstrating this for key outcomes appears in Appendix \@ref(app-framing).]  Manipulation checks (see Appendix \@ref(app-manip-wmt)) confirm that the video treatment did indeed increase respondent awareness of the ACNT, as expected whereas the placebo had no effect.   Thus we display results for binary treatment/control in the analysis below.  Based on the findings in the Home Depot sample, I pre-registered a plan to examine whether treatment effects differ based on pre-exposure to the ACNT, measured using the same question format as in the Home Depot survey.

```

At the end of Study 3, respondents had the opportunity to click on a link to take them to a page where they could donate to the ACNT. Based on past research, we expect those exposed to the emotional appeal in the video to be more willing to donate  [@andreoniPowerAskingHow2011; @bekkersLiteratureReviewEmpirical2011].  

In the Walmart sample, we see a low baseline willingness to click on the link of `r round(100*donation_summary$prop[1])`%.  Nevertheless, those seeing the EHF video were about 4 percentage points (or 35\%, $p < 0.05$) more likely to take an action to donate. Table \@ref(tab:tab-donate-models-wmt-app) presents regression-based estimates of treatment effects, using OLS and logistic regression.  We also include Firth regression to address concerns with rare events.  Treatment significantly increases willingness to take an action to donate.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Finally, the literature has given limited attention to how knowledge and awareness of government programs affects private charitable behavior, despite theoretical reasons to expect that information constraints may moderate crowding out effects. This represents an important avenue for future research, particularly relevant to understanding how employee knowledge of government programs might affect participation in workplace charitable mechanisms.

# Alternative specifications & Study 3








Past generations of workers built organizations to help one another in hard times.  Some of these mutual aid societies eventually transformed into full-fledged trade unions.  Others morphed into mutual insurance companies that later informed government social insurance programs [@deswaanWorkersClientsMutualism1986].  Such organizations transformed workplace relations, socialized workers into political life, and produced labor-based political movements. 

Employers have tremendous leeway to introduce or modify benefit plans and workplace programs that may influence workers perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors including around actions like unionization. EHFs are one such tax-incentivized program that has received virtually no systematic study.  This oversight is all the more remarkable as EHFs clearly echo both an earlier era of welfare capitalism and past mutual aid initiatives that produced and modern labor unions.

The lack of any substitution effect between EHFs and support for public assistance suggests that EHFs may represent a reconfiguration of the moral economy of low-wage work, a recognition of the public system's many failings.  Rather than a substitute for social insurance and assistance, EHFs are low-cost signals of corporate values and selective benevolence.

EHFs present a tractable, unexploited context to study important questions in the social sciences and management.  EHFs present a well-defined intervention for studying  whether "private governance" initiatives actually benefit workers themselves [@anderson_private_2017; @ahlquist_firm_2020; @locke_promise_2013; @malesky_chains_2018; @distelhorst_does_2017; ].      

I argue that EHFs are a blend of employer-driven welfare capitalism and worker mutual aid.  Drawing on interviews with executives and EHF managers, I expect EHFs to be closely connected to the corporate culture in which they are embedded, producing mixed and contingent effects on worker attitudes. Using three original, pre-registered studies, I present the first _systematic_ description of worker awareness and experience with EHFs as well as experimental evidence on the effect of corporate messaging around EHFs. I show that EHFs can build attachment to employers and coworkers when they are generous, well-promoted, and align with other corporate signals and management practices, but they do not affect workers' subjective financial security.

In study 1, I use a survey of US retail workers to describe retail workers' awareness of EHF programs among major employers, their level of interest in such programs, and their preferred influence over how the fund is run.  I find that awareness is limited and retail workers are not well-informed about which firms offer such programs.  Nevertheless, when weighed against other job amenities, emergency cash support is second only to paid time off in inducing workers to consider a hypothetical job offer at another retailer.  Respondents strongly support the creation of an EHF at their current employer and preferred a program in which workers themselves have meaningful influence over fund management.

In studies 2 and 3,  I focus on workers at two large retailers with long-standing EHF programs: the Home Depot and Walmart.  Both firms have EHFs that are over two decades old and managed in-house.   But the firms and programs differ in important ways.  The Home Depot EHF, the Homer Fund, is considerably more generous (with a maximum grant of \$10,000 against Walmart's \$1,500) and more heavily promoted among workers and executives.  IRS filing data indicates that the Homer Fund is also considerably larger than Walmart's EHF, even though Walmart is over three times the size of the Home Depot in US employee headcount.  Both firms also maintain strikingly different corporate cultures, with the Home Depot known for.^[According to the MIT Sloan Culture 500 rankings, based on analysis of Glassdoor postings, Walmart's]  

Using social media to manage the difficult task of recruiting a sample of workers linked to specific firms, I fielded original, independent surveys of Home Depot and Walmart workers. I find considerable differences in program awareness across employers.  Among Home Depot workers, awareness is "broad-but-thin": over 60% of Home Depot respondents displayed some awareness of the Homer Fund, but there were inconsistencies across measurement items, suggesting recognition but not real understanding. At Walmart, only 38% were aware of the program.  At both employers, tenure with the firm is the primary consistent predictor of EHF awareness and engagement.

In both studies 2 and 3, I use survey experiments to identify the impact of messages that raise EHF awareness.  Specifically, I exploit employer-produced promotional video messages about the EHF and look at effects on workers' subjective financial security, job attachment, and support for unionization and government-provided social insurance. In the Walmart survey I look at additional outcomes, including willingness to click on a link to donate to the EHF and perceptions about co-workers' support for unionization. 

In Study 2, Home Depot workers who were already aware of the Homer Fund prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, less supportive of unions, and less supportive of unemployment benefits, even after adjusting for job tenure.  The video treatment produced an average increase in job attachment of about 0.6 standard deviations on the relevant scale.  On average, the video treatment makes workers more _uncertain_ about unionization.  Further decomposing treatment effects, I find that the Homer Fund video treatment effects were largely concentrated among respondents _unaware_ of the EHF prior to my survey. Among this group, the video treatment significantly reduced support for unionization while increasing uncertainty (as opposed to outright opposition).

In Study 3, I find both similarities and differences with Study 2.  As in the Home Depot sample, Walmart workers who were already aware of their EHF prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, and less supportive of unions, even after adjusting for job tenure.  For the experiment in Study 3, I construct a custom video vignette that reproduced the Homer Fund video for the Walmart context.  The video treatment again produced no detectable effect on perceived financial stability.  But, contrary to findings in the Home Depot sample, I find no evidence of a treatment effect on job attachment, including quit intentions.  The video treatment did produce a four percentage point increase in the likelihood a respondent takes an action to donate.  The video treatment reduces opposition to unionization and increases (by four percentage points) the percent of coworkers expected to vote for unionization.   In contrast to the Home Depot sample, the Walmart sample showed no evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects based on prior knowledge of the Walmart EHF, known as the Associates in Critical Need Trust Together Fund (ACNT).

From a policy perspective, EHFs appear to resonate with a felt need among low-wage retail workers in the US today.  But, as the Home Depot and Walmart surveys indicate, program details, context, and promotion matter for the effects they might have on the workforce.  These programs operate in the shadow of eroded public welfare institutions, yet they are funded in part by favorable tax treatment.  Are the benefits these programs provide worth the tax expenditures?  How do these programs change when workers themselves have a voice in how they are run? 

Workers value emergency aid arrangements, which coincides with the renewed emphasis on mutual aid--and other solidaristic selective incentives--as a basis for rebuilding worker solidarity [@hertel-fernandez_why_nodate; @jarley_unions_2005; @horowitz_mutualism_2021].  The development, management, and outreach around programs like EHFs provide a clear point of common interest between workers, unions, and management.  To date this possibility remains unexplored.


nor do they displace support for public benefits.


EHFs present a fascinating window into employer behavior and the state of the low wage labor market in the US and beyond. Future research can extend in a variety of productive directions.  


and more supportive of unemployment insurance

There is no detectable treatment effect on attitudes towards government programs in support of the unemployed or those facing hardship.


@hadziabdicPrivateSpannerPublic2022

EHF may be viewed as "private insurance", which could dampen support for social insurance. Prompting workers with information about their employer's EHF will reduce workers' willingness to vote for unionization and reduce stated support for government aid programs for unemployment or emergencies.


@fishbackSocialInsurancePublic2020

 attitudes, or beliefs about the welfare state?
 
 Some EHFs appear to be the result of spontaneous initiatives from executives, often in response to a major natural disaster affecting a region closely connected to the firm and its employees.^[Disaster aid and social insurance are closely linked in the US [@landis_fate_1999].]  Based on interviews, this often stemmed from frustration with the slow and uneven government aid. 

Even before COVID-19, there was plenty of evidence that the existing social insurance and welfare systems were stigmatizing, encumbered with numerous "administrative burdens" [@herd_administrative_2019], and straining to deliver to those in need.  Several informants suggested that EHFs may present a private, partial complement to a weakening or slow public system.  By locating mutual aid programs in the firm, program participation might be higher and the EHF can benefit from corporate resources.  Applying for an EHF grant may be easier or less stigmatizing than applying for government assistance and the turn around time for benefits could be much faster in times of acute need.^[The Home Depot claims that grants are processed within 7 business days of application receipt, far faster than welfare or unemployment benefits, which also require waiting periods in many states.]
