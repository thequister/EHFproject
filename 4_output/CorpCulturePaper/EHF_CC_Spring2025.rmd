\begin{abstract}
\begin{singlespace} 

Hundreds of U.S. employers have created Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs) to distribute emergency cash to their workers using donations pooled from employees themselves.  While corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are often studied as tools to shape reputation, less is known about how inward-oriented CSR relates to corporate culture and labor relations. This paper offers the first systematic evidence on EHFs and their effects on worker attitudes. Drawing on three original, pre-registered studies I show that EHFs are popular among workers, they can foster affective attachment to employers and coworkers, and they can shift attitudes about unionization. But these effects vary in ways that reflect differences in program generosity, visibility, and alignment with corporate culture. More robust programs can strengthen employer loyalty and reduce support for unionization, while weaker efforts risk appearing insincere. The findings contribute to understanding the contingent role of CSR and private welfare initiatives as instruments of corporate governance in a precarious labor market.\\

<!---
Hundreds of US employers have created “employee hardship funds” (EHFs). EHFs pool money donations from a firm’s workers in order to offer cash grants to the firm’s employees in unforeseen emergencies. Do workers know about and engage with these programs? Do they have any impact on workers’ financial well-being or job attachment? Can they be deployed for union avoidance? I use original surveys of workers at two large employers with well-established EHFs as well as a sample of retail workers nationwide to study these questions. Retail workers have limited knowledge of these programs.  At firms with EHFs, I find “broad but thin” levels of worker awareness that reflects employer promotional effort. Using survey experiments that exploit novel video vignettes, I find mixed results: At a firm with a generous and well-promoted EHF, treatment increases worker attachment to both co-workers and the employer and increases uncertainty about unionization; these effects are concentrated among workers unaware of their employer’s EHF before the survey.  At the firm with the less generous program, I find weaker or non-existent effects, although the EHF treatment in this case reduces opposition to unionization. There is no evidence that EHFs affect workers’ perceived financial security and no evidence that EHFs "substitute" for public social insurance programs in the minds of workers.  Findings have implications for studying the "moral economy" between low-wage workers and employers in the US as well as unionization and union avoidance.  Findings also have implications for the study of charitable giving, organizational attachment, and solidarity.

 Do workers know about and engage with these programs? Can EHFs shape worker attitudes? Using three original surveys---including two matched to workers at specific employers with EHFs with embedded experiments---I find that awareness of EHFs is significant but shallow and shaped by employer promotional efforts. Among workers at a firm with a generous, well-promoted EHF, experimental treatment increases job attachment and reduces support for unionization, especially among workers previously unaware of the program. These effects are absent or reversed at the second firm, where the program is less robust and less tightly integrated into the corporate culture. EHFs do not improve perceived financial security. Findings have implications for studying unionization and union avoidance as well as the ``moral economy'' between low-wage workers and employers in the US.

From the small startup to the large multinational enterprise, firms now implement a wide variety of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to influence external audiences and internal stakeholders—-particularly employees. Under certain conditions, CSR programs can help attract value-aligned workers, foster attachment to the firm and to coworkers, reduce turnover, and even elicit increased work effort [@ruppEmployeeReactionsCorporate2006; @turbanCorporateSocialPerformance1997; @bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021; @bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @greeningCorporateSocialPerformance2000; @portocarreroEffectsShortTermCorporate2024; @toninCorporatePhilanthropyProductivity2015]. These positive effects on workers also depend on workers' perceptions of management motives, CSR alignment with other corporate practices, and the range of other jobs on offer [@cassarIntentionsDoingGood2021; @burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022; @listWhenCorporateSocial2021; @zhaoInfluenceCorporateSocial2022; @brisceseWhoBenefitsCorporate2021]. CSR efforts that appear inauthentic or inconsistent with internal management culture may backfire.  Yet this literature focuses entirely on outwardly-directed CSR activities: corporate philanthropy, volunteerism, and environmental sustainability efforts. Much less is known about *inward*-oriented CSR--that is, voluntary charitable programs directing support to internal stakeholders—-and how it relates to workplace culture and labor relations.

In the contemporary U.S., this question is especially urgent. Unionization rates remain historically low, public welfare and social insurance systems are under strain, and non-standard and precarious employment arrangements are increasingly widespread [@abrahamMeasuringGigEconomy2021; @hackerGreatRiskShift2019]. Workers in the lower half of the earnings and education distributions face stagnating wages and rising economic insecurity, even as fissured workplaces and distributed supply chains make it harder to develop occupational identities and coworker networks that once supported collective action [@ahlquistResearchFrontiersInstitutional2018; @naiduThereAnyFuture2022; @thelenAmericanPrecariatCapitalism2019; @weilFissuredWorkplace2014].  Economic precarity itself induces a ``cognitive tax'' on workers, negatively affecting numerous aspects of their lives, including job performance [@meurisPriceFinancialPrecarity2018; @meurisHighCostLow2015; @leanaOrganizationalBehaviorWorking2012; @mullainathanScarcity2013].

Against this backdrop, a growing number of U.S. employers now sponsor Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs): tax-advantaged programs that provide emergency cash grants to workers, usually funded through donations from employees themselves. EHFs revive earlier elements of both  worker mutual aid arrangements and "welfare capitalism" [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976; @jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998], but they have attracted almost no scholarly attention. We know virtually nothing about how workers perceive EHFs, whether they affect job attachment, or how they influence support for unionization. EHFs thus provide a tractable and unexplored context for studying how private governance initiatives impact workers [@lockePromiseLimitsPrivate2013; @ahlquistFirmParticipationVoluntary2020; @distelhorstDoesLeanImprove2017; @brisceseWhoBenefitsCorporate2021] while also connecting with the cross-disciplinary literature on worker support for unionization [@ahlquistRiseUnionCurious2024; @kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019; @pezoldLaborMarketTightness2023].

I argue that EHFs represent a contemporary form of employer-driven welfare capitalism that echoes the mutual aid arrangements associated with labor unions. Interviews with corporate executives and EHF managers suggest that EHFs are, more than anything, vehicles for inculcating corporate culture and values.  I therefore expect that EHFs will produce mixed and contingent effects on worker attitudes depending on program structure and broader corporate culture. I document basic empirical facts about EHFs and test this argument using three original, pre-registered studies.^[The study was pre-registered as.  In appendix XX, I document where the research design or analysis deviates from the pre-registered studies.]

Study 1 is a national survey of U.S. retail workers, designed to map awareness of EHF programs across major employers, gauge worker interest in such programs, and examine preferences for program governance.   I find that retail workers are not well-informed about which firms sponsor EHF programs, suggesting that EHFs are not widely used as a recruitment or screening mechanism for attracting value-aligned workers.  Nevertheless, when weighed against other job amenities, emergency cash support is second only to paid time off in inducing workers to consider a hypothetical job offer at another retailer.  Respondents strongly support the creation of an EHF at their current employer and preferred a program in which workers themselves have meaningful influence over fund management.

Studies 2 and 3 involve two survey experiments, conducted with workers at the Home Depot and Walmart—-large retailers with different corporate cultures as well as longstanding but differently structured EHFs--to identify how EHF messaging affects workers’ subjective financial security, job attachment, and support for unionization.  Messages about generous and well-promoted programs, as at Home Depot, increase job attachment and reduce support for unionization, particularly among workers previously unaware of the program. In contrast, a less generous and less visible program at Walmart produces negligible and sometimes opposite effects. But in neither context do EHFs significantly affect workers’ perceived financial security, contrary to the programs' purported intentions [@finfitEstablishingEmployeeRelief2023; @schneiderHowLeadersCan2022; @rodriguezEmployeeHardshipFunds2020].

These findings provide the first systematic evidence on inward-oriented CSR in the form of Employee Hardship Funds, an increasingly common but under-studied set of programs in the U.S. These studies are also the first to exploit actual employer messages about existing EHFs as experimental treatments. The differences between the Home Depot and Walmart suggest that, just as with outwardly-oriented CSR, the effects of inward-oriented CSR on workers depend on both the nature of the program itself as well as other corporate practices, norms, and messages that form a corporate culture. While EHFs can function as tools of corporate governance, such effects are neither automatic nor universal.

The overwhelming majority of research into CSR effects on workers occurs in the context of professional services and finance [@bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @brammerContributionCorporateSocial2007; @portocarreroEffectsShortTermCorporate2024], the lab [@brisceseWhoBenefitsCorporate2021], or online labor markets [@burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021; @burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022; @burbanoSocialResponsibilityMessages2016].  There is virtually no work looking at the effect of CSR on frontline workers in more common employment environments such as retail. This study thus expands to empirical scope of the literature.

Finally, this study is, to my knowledge, the first to link CSR and unionization.  Research on union avoidance emphasizes either employer attempts to preempt unionization by improving wages and benefits or employers' use of captive audience meetings, threats, and retaliatory firings during the unionization drives that do occur [@taschereau-dumouchelUnionThreat2020; @farberNonunionWageRates2005; @bronfenbrennerIntensificationEmployerOpposition2009; @laferFearWorkAccount2020; @stansburyUSFirmsHave2021]. Findings here suggest there is scope for inward-oriented CSR--in the form of EHFs--to reduce support for unionization, but these effects depend greatly on execution and, even then, have limits.  There is also a renewed emphasis on mutual aid as a basis for rebuilding worker solidarity [@hertel-fernandezWhyPublicSector2021; @jarleyUnionsSocialCapital2005; @horowitzMutualismBuildingNext2021]. EHFs can clearly play a role here, although I have not uncovered any examples of unions and management exploring EHFs as a potential area of common interest.

The next section provides details about EHFs, how they vary, and their growth.  Section XX reviews the relevant literature and poses the core reseach questions and hypotheses.  Section XX describes the research design and case selection.  Sections XX-XX present results.  Section XX concludes.  Details about the survey samples, pre-analysis plan, and supplementary data analysis are collected in the appendicies.

In the contemporary United States, unions are vanishing and the welfare and social insurance systems are creaking. Temporary and other "non-standard" employment relationships are increasingly widespread [@abraham_measuring_2018].  Yet such work arrangements fail to provide access to traditional social insurance and labor market protections. Americans in the lower half of the education and earnings distributions have seen years of stagnating wages while also bearing more economic risk [@hacker_great_2019].  Precarious employment, "fissured" workplaces, and distributed supply chains make it more difficult for workers to develop the occupational identities and dense networks of coworkers that supported the organization-building of the past [@ahlquist_research_2018;@thelen_american_2019;@naidu_is_nodate;@weil_fissured_2014].  

Even as unions and social protections atrophy, employers across the U.S. are sponsoring a new form of private mutual aid: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs). These tax-exempt programs distribute emergency cash grants to workers, funded in part through donations raised from the workers themselves. Although EHFs recall earlier eras of "welfare capitalism" [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976;@jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998], these programs have gone largely unstudied. What do workers know about them? Can they influence job attachment and support for unionization?  What does this tell us about the "moral economy" between low-wage workers and employers in the US today?

EHFs present a tractable, unexploited context to study important questions in the social sciences and management.  EHFs present a well-defined intervention for studying  whether "private governance" initiatives actually benefit workers themselves [@anderson_private_2017; @ahlquist_firm_2020; @locke_promise_2013; @malesky_chains_2018; @distelhorst_does_2017; ].      

I argue that EHFs are a blend of employer-driven welfare capitalism and worker mutual aid.  Drawing on interviews with executives and EHF managers, I expect EHFs to be closely connected to the corporate culture in which they are embedded, producing mixed and contingent effects on worker attitudes. Using three original, pre-registered studies, I present the first _systematic_ description of worker awareness and experience with EHFs as well as experimental evidence on the effect of corporate messaging around EHFs. I show that EHFs can build attachment to employers and coworkers when they are generous, well-promoted, and align with other corporate signals and management practices, but they do not affect workers' subjective financial security.

In study 1, I use a survey of US retail workers to describe retail workers' awareness of EHF programs among major employers, their level of interest in such programs, and their preferred influence over how the fund is run.  I find that awareness is limited and retail workers are not well-informed about which firms offer such programs.  Nevertheless, when weighed against other job amenities, emergency cash support is second only to paid time off in inducing workers to consider a hypothetical job offer at another retailer.  Respondents strongly support the creation of an EHF at their current employer and preferred a program in which workers themselves have meaningful influence over fund management.

In studies 2 and 3,  I focus on workers at two large retailers with long-standing EHF programs: the Home Depot and Walmart.  Both firms have EHFs that are over two decades old and managed in-house.   But the firms and programs differ in important ways.  The Home Depot EHF, the Homer Fund, is considerably more generous (with a maximum grant of \$10,000 against Walmart's \$1,500) and more heavily promoted among workers and executives.  IRS filing data indicates that the Homer Fund is also considerably larger than Walmart's EHF, even though Walmart is over three times the size of the Home Depot in US employee headcount.  Both firms also maintain strikingly different corporate cultures, with the Home Depot known for.^[According to the MIT Sloan Culture 500 rankings, based on analysis of Glassdoor postings, Walmart's]  

Using social media to manage the difficult task of recruiting a sample of workers linked to specific firms, I fielded original, independent surveys of Home Depot and Walmart workers. I find considerable differences in program awareness across employers.  Among Home Depot workers, awareness is "broad-but-thin": over 60% of Home Depot respondents displayed some awareness of the Homer Fund, but there were inconsistencies across measurement items, suggesting recognition but not real understanding. At Walmart, only 38% were aware of the program.  At both employers, tenure with the firm is the primary consistent predictor of EHF awareness and engagement.

In both studies 2 and 3, I use survey experiments to identify the impact of messages that raise EHF awareness.  Specifically, I exploit employer-produced promotional video messages about the EHF and look at effects on workers' subjective financial security, job attachment, and support for unionization and government-provided social insurance. In the Walmart survey I look at additional outcomes, including willingness to click on a link to donate to the EHF and perceptions about co-workers' support for unionization. 

In Study 2, Home Depot workers who were already aware of the Homer Fund prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, less supportive of unions, and less supportive of unemployment benefits, even after adjusting for job tenure.  The video treatment produced an average increase in job attachment of about 0.6 standard deviations on the relevant scale.  On average, the video treatment makes workers more _uncertain_ about unionization.  Further decomposing treatment effects, I find that the Homer Fund video treatment effects were largely concentrated among respondents _unaware_ of the EHF prior to my survey. Among this group, the video treatment significantly reduced support for unionization while increasing uncertainty (as opposed to outright opposition).

In Study 3, I find both similarities and differences with Study 2.  As in the Home Depot sample, Walmart workers who were already aware of their EHF prior to the survey were more confident in their financial stability, more attached to their employer and coworkers, and less supportive of unions, even after adjusting for job tenure.  For the experiment in Study 3, I construct a custom video vignette that reproduced the Homer Fund video for the Walmart context.  The video treatment again produced no detectable effect on perceived financial stability.  But, contrary to findings in the Home Depot sample, I find no evidence of a treatment effect on job attachment, including quit intentions.  The video treatment did produce a four percentage point increase in the likelihood a respondent takes an action to donate.  The video treatment reduces opposition to unionization and increases (by four percentage points) the percent of coworkers expected to vote for unionization.   In contrast to the Home Depot sample, the Walmart sample showed no evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects based on prior knowledge of the Walmart EHF, known as the Associates in Critical Need Trust Together Fund (ACNT).

# EHFs in practice

The Home Depot and Walmart are two of the largest retailers in the world, with approximately 420,000 and 1.6 million 2024 US employees, respectively. These firms compete to some degree in both product and labor markets and both have experienced union activism. Their job benefits, programs, and procedures have an impact on the retail industry as a whole as well as the communities surrounding their establishments [@wiltshireWalmartSupercentersMonopsony2023; @derenoncourtVoluntaryMinimumWages2025; @wartzmanStillBrokeWalmarts2022].

The Home Depot has maintained the Homer Fund since 1999 while Walmart started the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT) in 2001.^[ACNT has since renamed as the ACNT Together Fund.]  Both programs are set up as non-profit charities (501c(3)) offering cash grants for employees facing emergency expenses.  The Homer Fund makes grants of up to \$10,000 while the Walmart fund makes grants of up to \$1,500.  Beyond simple generosity, the programs differ in multiple ways, including application procedures and the frequency with which a worker can receive a grant.   Both funds take (tax deductible) corporate funds while also soliciting (tax deductible) donations from both corporate and front-line employees.  Grants to workers are tax-exempt under US law.

Both ACNT and the Homer Fund are examples of Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  Such funds have grown rapidly since 2001, when the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) amended its rules to allow employer-controlled non-profit foundations to provide direct cash assistance to employees who suffer a "qualifying event." Qualifying events typically include unforeseen emergencies such as natural disasters, crime victimization, house fires, terrorist or military actions, etc. [@internalrevenueserviceDisasterReliefProviding2014; @aprillCharitableClassDisaster2016].  Funds can only be used for basic living expenses (food, clothing, transportation, housing/house repair, burial) for the recipient and immediate family [@internalrevenueserviceDisasterReliefProviding2014].

We know very little about EHFs.  There is a small practitioner literature [@associationofdisasterrelieffundsandemployeehardshipfundsEnvironmentalScanDisaster2013; @employeerelieffundeducationgroupEnvironmentalScanDisaster2019;@aspeninstituteIlluminatingHiddenSafety2019; @rodriguezEmployeeHardshipFunds2020;@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020], but scholarly attention has been minimal and oblique^[@amorimScheduleUnpredictabilityHighCost2022; @reichWorkingRespectCommunity2018 are the only two peer-reviewed pieces mentioning EHFs of which I am aware.] Existing reports largely rely on interviews with EHF grant recipients and aggregated data on grant disbursement to document how EHF grants helped recipients in need.  None of the existing studies reports basic descriptive information such as employee awareness and engagement rates nor do they document overall effects among the broader workforce. We have no knowledge about selection into grant application or receipt nor is there information about how these programs operate at scale. 

Lacking a central database of EHFs, we have positively documented over 320 companies operating EHFs as of January 2025. Nine of the ten top US retailers by revenue have maintained an EHF. There is sufficient corporate interest in EHFs that a cottage industry in EHF management has developed.  Many employers now outsource the administration of their EHFs to third-party nonprofit agencies, such as the Employee Assistance Foundation (EAF), E4E Relief, America's Charities, and Canary.  EAF claims to have over 400 clients [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022]. 

EHFs appear to be expanding along both the extensive and intensive margins in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Levi Strauss & Co. reported a three-fold increase in applications to their EHF in 2020 [@@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020], with another spike in applications once coronavirus emergency aid programs expired in the US.  The Home Depot suspended fundraising from employees and expedited grant processing during the pandemic emergency. EAF reported a more than tenfold increase in grant applications relative to historical averages in the first two quarters of 2020 as well as 140 new client EHFs [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].   In May 2020 Amazon.com launched its EHF--using \$25 million in corporate money--in the face of extensive criticism of its workplace safety practices during the coronavirus outbreak as well as ongoing attempts to unionize its warehouse and fulfillment centers.  Amazon shuttered its EHF in August 2022.  

Figures \@ref(fig:fig-tpm) and \@ref(fig:fig-HfACNTcomps) further illustrate the scale and growth of EHFs using data from IRS 990 forms [@lecyNCCSIRS9902023; @suozzoProPublicaNonprofitExplorer2025].^[If a firm contracts with a third party to provide an EHF program, the firm essentially rents the third party's IRS identification number (EIN).  All donations and grants are linked to the third party's EIN, not the original firm.  With a large number of employers offering EHFs through third party providers, we cannot systematically identify firms with and without EHFs through IRS nonprofit filings.  EHFs directly visible in IRS filing data appear to be older EHFs at larger firms.] Figure \@ref(fig:fig-tpm) compares the revenues and total grants paid out to individuals from four EHF outsourcing organizations.  EAF, the oldest and largest, has grown rapidly since first appearing in IRS data in 2012, reaching over \$144 million in revenue and \$86 million in grants to individuals in 2020. The data also show the recent entry of several competitor organizations, with E4E and America's Charities operating a similar scales in recent years and Canary growing rapidly.

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-HfACNTcomps) zooms in on the Home Depot's Homer Fund and Walmart's ACNT, two in-house EHFs that we will examine in more detail.  In the left panel I report net assets for both firms' nonprofit foundations.^[For tax purposes, both Homer Fund and ACNT EHFs are part of the larger Home Depot and Walmart corporate foundations, respectively.]  Both corporate charities show strong growth from 2010, but Homer Fund is operating at more than double the ACNT's size.  The right panel looks at grants to domestic individuals, my preferred indicator of EHF activity.^[The larger foundations typically focus on disbursing grants to other nonprofit and community organizations, as opposed to individuals.  The Homer Fund website reports disbursing \$17 million in 2023 EHF grants whereas the Home Depot foundation 2023 IRS form 990 reports \$19.1 million in grants to individuals.]  Homer Fund is making \$15-25 million in annual grants between 2008 and 2022 whereas ACNT typically disburses less than \$10 million, notwithstanding Walmart's much larger corporate presence.  Homer Fund reports making a total of over \$267 million in grants to more than 183,000 individuals over its existence. ACNT claims to have disbursed over \$142 million over its existence to over 145,000 workers.   

The examples above illustrate how EHFs vary across firms in virtually all programmatic aspects including longevity, eligibility requirements, application procedures, grant generosity and frequency, funding structure, and even whether they are managed in-house or out-sourced to third parties. Although all EHFs have a mutual aid component, communication around the programs varies in tone and intensity.  Some firms, such as the Home Depot, aggressively promote their EHF programs, including through dedicated social media and YouTube channels as well as regular donation drives.  Others, such as Walmart, appear to put substantially less effort into promoting their program. And messaging varies, sometimes emphasizing charitable motivations, sometimes emphasizing solidarity with co-workers, and sometimes framing the EHF as more of a job amenity.

Despite these differences, all the EHFs we documented share their main stated purpose: improving the financial resilience of the workforce.  We examine whether EHFs are achieving this outcome by testing the first hypothesis:   

- **H1 (Financial Security):** Exposure to EHF messaging improves workers' sense of financial security in the face of unexpected need.  

Two critical features distinguish EHFs from other job amenities or employer-based insurance benefits, making EHFs particularly interesting from a CSR and corporate governance perspective.  The first is their mutual aid nature.  In EHFs, employers ask both corporate and frontline workers to donate their own money into a fund, with the goal of assisting fellow employees in need. The employer sponsors the outreach and administrative apparatus for soliciting and directing charitable contributions towards their own workforce.    

Second, EHFs are potentially accessible to hourly, part-time, and contract workers.  This sets EHFs apart from other benefits and labor protections that only accrue to directly-employed workers, especially those working full-time or in salaried positions. The increasingly "fissured" workplace can save some labor-related costs in the near term, but pose additional challenges [@weilFissuredWorkplace2014; @tonWhyGoodJobs2012]. EHFs are one tool firms can use to direct some benefits to their workers--perhaps improving morale and blunting public criticism--while retaining the savings that make non-standard labor contracting attractive.  There are examples consistent with this interpretation. Amazon.com restricted its EHF to "Amazon Flex Delivery Partners, Delivery Service Partner Delivery Associates, Temporary Associates employed by eligible staffing agencies, and drivers of eligible line haul partners," i.e., non-standard, temporary contract labor.  EAF updated its EHF program guidelines, recommending that employers "include contractors, furloughed employees, and franchise employees" in their EHF schemes [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].

# Mutual aid, welfare capitalism, \& CSR

Although EHFs are a relatively recent development, mutual aid is not.  Workers in an industry, region, or ethnic group routinely pooled their savings to assist one another in hard times [@beitoMutualAidWelfare2000; @glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001; @dreyfusLabourMovementMutual1993].   Early mutual aid funds and friendly societies built upon and deepened existing social connections, creating dense webs of obligation and formal organizational structures [@ismayTrustStrangersFriendly2018]. These organizations were precursors to modern trade unions [@webbHistoryTradeUnionism1920; @bacharachMutualAidUnion2018; @jarleyUnionsSocialCapital2005], or even attempts to circumvent union repression [@morrisCriminalConspiracyEarly1937]. Many unions continued maintaining emergency aid programs and insurance schemes to support, recruit, and retain members [@dericksonWorkersHealthWorkers1988; @dreyfusLabourMovementMutual1993;@beitoMutualAidWelfare2000;@glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001;@olsonLogicCollectiveAction1965; @hertel-fernandezWhyPublicSector2021]. 

What distinguishes EHFs from past mutual aid programs are their employer-organized and firm-centered structure.  Workers do not organize or direct the EHF, a worker need not donate in order to apply for benefits (unlike in a strictly mutualist arrangement), and EHFs are usually employer-specific.  EHFs do not possess organizational structures that build social connections or organizational skill among workers themselves.  In some cases, workers in need must petition their direct supervisors to support their aid application.   

In this way, EHFs also hark back to the the era of "welfare capitalism" [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976;@jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998], when some employers provided extensive benefits and services to workers in efforts to retain workers and forestall unionization.  Some large industrial firms created employer-sponsored "company unions" that substituted for independent unions' social and mutual aid functions but lacked any means of challenging management  around issues of wages and benefits [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976].^[Such organizations were banned in the USA under the 1935 Wagner Act.]  Welfare capitalism frequently entailed considerable investments, altering the location and nature of production and credibly signalling corporate values, whether they be temperance or an anti-union stance.

Employers continue to offer wages and other amenities to preempt unionization, undermine unionization drives, and prevent workers from defecting to competitors  [@jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998;@bronfenbrennerIntensificationEmployerOpposition2009; @kochanWorkersOrganizingEfforts2022; @rosenTradeUnionPower1969; @taschereau-dumouchelUnionThreat2020; @ahlquistLaborUnionsPolitical2017; @bacharachMutualAidUnion2018; @neumannWhereHaveAll1984].  Interest in labor unions is at historically high levels [@mccarthyApprovalLaborUnions2022; @ahlquistWERNWorkersSurvey2023; @kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019], but unionization remains low in the United States and employers face reduced incentives to make the bigger investments of the past.  EHFs are a potentially attractive compromise.  They appear to address a real need but monetary commitments from the employer are low and discretionary.  Operations can be outsourced and grant awards can be adjusted at will to match resources, with little fanfare or oversight.  Funds come, in part, from workers themselves and contributions to the fund, especially from higher-paid executives, are treated as tax-deductible charitable donations.  EHFs take on a form and rhetoric that may connect with the same "social custom" or solidaristic motivations associated with unions [@akerlofTheorySocialCustom1980; @naylorEconomicTheoryOpen1993]. EHFs may even appear more desirable than a union, insofar as workers are not obligated to contribute in order to apply for EHF benefits and EHFs may receive corporate and executive donations. As such, EHFs may be useful as part of a broader union avoidance strategy.  

This suggests a second hypothesis:

- **H2 (Union Support):** Exposure to EHF messaging reduces support for unionization.  

## CSR and workers

Corporate philanthropy has a long history [@marinettoHistoricalDevelopmentBusiness1999].  In its contemporary, form this sustained philanthropy goes under the heading of corporate social responsibility (CSR).  CSR is increasingly understood as an important corporate governance mechanism, capable of influencing workers’ attachment, motivation, and identification with the firm [@ruppEmployeeReactionsCorporate2006; @turbanCorporateSocialPerformance1997]. This can happen through a variety of channels. Workers appear to place a high value on corporate culture and firms go to lengths to communicate values and culture to prospective employees [@huangCommunicatingCorporateCulture2024]. By broadcasting a commitment to pro-social activities, firms may attract and retain value-aligned workers or workers may interpret CSR as a credible signal of a respectful and supportive workplace [@brekkeAttractingResponsibleEmployees2008; @gortonCorporateCultureTheory2020; @greeningCorporateSocialPerformance2000]. These signals are especially important in large firms with widely distributed workforces, where symbolic gestures play a central role in shaping organizational culture at scale [@akerlofIdentityEconomicsHow2010].  In turn, greater affective attachment to the employer leads to less job search, worker turnover, and slower wage growth [@kampkotterEmployeeIdentificationWages2021].

This produces a clear hypothesis about EHFs: 

- **H2 (Awareness):** If EHFs are used to attract and screen for value-matched employees then workers should be widely aware of their own employer's EHF as well as the presence of EHFs at other major employers in the industry.

Beyond signalling and selection, there is evidence that CSR activities can shape both workers' beliefs about their employer and their economically relevant behavior.  Employees who participate in external CSR activities show stronger identification with the firm, greater attachment to coworkers, and reduced turnover   [@brammerContributionCorporateSocial2007; @bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @turbanCorporateSocialPerformance1997].  Experiments in the lab and online labor markets have shown that information about the employer's charitable activities reduces the wage required to attract higher-performing workers [@burbanoSocialResponsibilityMessages2016], increases worker productivity [@toninCorporatePhilanthropyProductivity2015], increases attachment and willingness to exert unpaid effort [@burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021;@cassarJobMissionSubstitute2019], and reduces misconduct [@burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022].^[But see @listWhenCorporateSocial2021.]  @portocarreroEffectsShortTermCorporate2024 use a field experiment to show that even a short social impact activity reduces turnover.  All this suggests that workers respond to perceived value alignment with their employer with improved organizational citizenship [@zhaoInfluenceCorporateSocial2022].

All of the experimental work linking CSR with workers examines *externally-oriented* CSR in the form of donations to charities, volunteer activities, or reduced-fee work for less-resourced clients in the nonprofit sector.  EHFs, on the other hand, combine elements of charity with those of mutual aid and in-group support.^[Whether there is any complementarity between internally- and externally-oriented CSR is an open question for future research.] Existing work on social identity theory and group identification suggests that inwardly-oriented CSR should exhibit similar or even stronger effects for job attachment, compared to externally-oriented activities [@linModelingCorporateCitizenship2010]. Research on mutual aid suggests that collective experiences of support can promote a sense of belonging and interdependence among otherwise disconnected workers, developing a sort of "community of fate" [@ahlquistInterestOthersOrganizations2013; @ismayTrustStrangersFriendly2018].  Several major retailers, including the Home Depot and Walmart, aggressively promoted their EHFs in their annual Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023], suggesting that these firms view EHFs as part of their broader CSR strategy.  

This leads to the third hypothesis:

- **H3 (Attachment):** Exposure to EHF messages increases workers’ job attachment.

Existing research has also demonstrated that CSR effects are contingent on how workers interpret managerial motives and corporate values [@gatignon-turnauMisUsingEmployeeVolunteering2015].  Strong corporate cultures emerge from on degree of consistency between stated values and actual practices and norms [@grahamCorporateCultureEvidence2022]. Whether a firm can realize the CSR benefits depends on the alignment between CSR activities and internal organizational practices  [@grantGivingTimeTime2012]. When CSR messages are paired with actions that signal distrust or control, such as increased surveillance, they may fail or even backfire [@burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022]. Similarly, @cassarIntentionsDoingGood2021 demonstrates that employees respond more positively when CSR initiatives appear sincere rather than strategic or insincere.

In both public statements and author interviews with EHF practitioners, the link between EHFs and corporate culture is clear. Walmart's ACNT annual report was explicit:

> "When our founder, Sam Walton, began the now-famous tradition of 'passing the hat' at Saturday Morning Meetings years ago, he laid the foundation for a culture of caring and giving back to fellow associates. It’s a tradition that endures today through the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT)."  @walmartaccociatesincriticalneedtrustACNTFiscalYear2020, 4

I conducted six semi-structured interviews with high-level executives directly responsible for designing and implementing EHF programs in-house or through outsourcing arrangements.  An executive at a large apparel company that runs the EHF went further than Walmart: 

> "The values are incredibly authentic and ingrained in the company...this is the proof point of our  corporate value of empathy. And it's very much the center of the  culture...We have a eligible  on day one rule for current employees." [@corporatephilanthropyexecutiveatanapparelcompanyEHFInterview12024]

An executive at a third-party EHF outsourcing organization made a similar observation: 

> "[The employees] love their program so much. It's so built into the culture of belonging and giving and take care. And so I think when it gets that closely tied, they continue to give resources to make sure that they can care for folks." [@maretingandcommunicationexecutiveatehfthirdpartyproviderEHFInterview32024] 

But another interviewee, the CEO of a midsized health services firm, recognized how firms might approach the programs differently: 

 > "There's wide variability in purpose. Also, I mean, you know, on one end of the spectrum it could just be used as like a quantitative retention tool, and on the other end is, you know, to contribute to a social good. And you know, a lot of both." [@seniorexecutiveatamidsizehealthservicesfirmEHFInterview62025]

Finally, one executive at a third-party outsourcing organization reflected on how perceived EHF generosity connects to labor relations:

 > The most important KPI for us to track is our [grant application] approval rate...I think a program with a low approval rate does more harm than good to the employee-employer relationship." [@executiveatehfthirdpartyproviderEHFInterview52025]

This produces a fourth hypothesis:

- **H4 (Contingency):** The effects of EHF messaging on job attachment and union support will be stronger where the program is more generous and where the program is more deeply emebedded in an organizational culture that emphasizes mutual obligation and teamwork.

## Why EHFs?

To explore why firms I conducted semi-structured interviews with EHF practitioners to hear how they conceived of the program as understand the administrative challenges and decisions.  Ultimately I was able to interview 6 practitioners, ranging from executives at EHF outsourcing organizations to EHF program managers at large firms to executives at mid-size enterprises operating an EHF.

Documenting cross-firm variation in EHFs is not the focus of this paper, 

## Research goals and scope conditions

Cross-firm variation in EHFs is important for understanding the programs' possible effects.  But we also want to document EHF _effects_ to understand why firms might create these programs and how they might differ.  Because EHFs are ostensibly targeted at workers and for reasons of tractability, this paper concentrates on how workers interact with EHFs.  Systematic documentation of cross-firm variation in the presence and design of EHF programs will be part of future research. 

As noted above, we know very little about these programs, meaning there are important unanswered descriptive questions. In this paper, I concentrate on workers.  What proportion of workers are even aware of their employer's EHF?  Are they aware of these programs at other employers in their industry?  What proportion have engaged with the EHF (contributed, applied, received a grant)? What are the predictors of EHF awareness and engagement? How much do workers value EHFs relative to other job amenities?

For reasons of theoretical interest as well as tractability, I am interested in how a company's workforce interacts with an EHF, _not_ the effect of receiving an EHF grant for an individual in need.  Only a small proportion of a firm's employees is ever likely to qualify and apply for EHF assistance, making it quite difficult to credibly compare grant recipients with non-recipients.^[Based on estimates from Study 1, `r round(100*sum(genpop$acs_weight_trim[genpop$emergency=="Yes"]/sum(genpop$acs_weight_trim)))`% of retail workers may have experienced a potential "qualifying event" in the last year.] More importantly the presence of a program may well have effects on workers, regardless of whether an individual ever receives a grant. There is not a convincing empirical strategy for identifying EHF causal effects at the firm level. Instead I pursue a tractable individual-level strategy in which I use survey experiments to manipulate the information and salience of EHFs for workers in my surveys. I am therefore careful to account for whether a respondent was aware of the EHF program (i.e., "pre-exposed") prior to the survey.

In pursuing this strategy, I recognize that EHFs may have effects distinct from the reasons why a firm sponsors an EHF.  Managers may have intentions for the EHF that the program fails to achieve.  EHFs may also have unplanned consequences. The research design in this paper speaks to whether realistic informational campaigns about an EHF _could_ affect worker attitudes, for example by calling attention to an EHF as part of a worker on-boarding process or anti-unionization strategy.

# Study 1
In study 1, I set out to answer basic descriptive questions: are workers aware of EHFs?  How accurate is their knowledge?  How attractive do they find EHFs, relative to other job amenities? I concentrate on the retail industry, which employed more than 16 million Americans in 2024.  Retail is known for low wages, poor benefits, high turnover, and several high-profile recent unionization drives.

I fielded an original survey using the Cloud Research incentivized panel, targeting US respondents 18+ employed in retail.^[Of those targeted, only respondents with US IP addresses, who passed a screening question confirming employment in the retail industry, and who successfully passed two different attention check questions were allowed to complete the survey.  Respondents with duplicate IP addresses reporting identical demographic values were also excluded.]  The survey was in the field from February 12 - 22, 2025 and produced `r nrow(genpop)` valid responses.  Using the 2024 American Community Survey-reported demographics for US adults working in retail, we constructed post-stratification weights based on gender, race, and education. All descriptive quantities below represent weighted calculations.  Descriptive statistics appear in Appendix @app-genpop-survsum.    

## Worker awareness
```{r genpop-awareness-calcs, echo=FALSE}
genpop_aware_tab<-summarise(genpop_w,
          got.ehf.prop = survey_mean(emerg_assist_benefits=="Yes", 
                                         na.rm=TRUE),
          aware.prior.prop = survey_mean(ehf_prior_know=="Yes", na.rm=T) 
          #know.prop = survey_mean(HF_know=="Yes", na.rm=T),  # too many NAs
          #applied.prop = survey_mean(HF_applied=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #received.prop = survey_mean(HF_received=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #donated.prop = survey_mean(HF_donate=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #eligible.prop = survey_mean(Q4.2=="Yes", na.rm=T),
          )
```

We asked respondents which of a list of benefits and programs they had at their current retail job.  The EHF response on this list is "Emergency cash assistance to help in unexpected hard times." We find that `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$got.ehf.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$got.ehf.prop_se)`%) report that their current employer offers emergency cash support and  `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$aware.prior.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$aware.prior.prop_se)`%) said that they had heard of EHF programs prior to taking the survey.^[All respondents in Study 1 answered the following question before responding to questions about EHF engagement: "Some companies offer their employees programs called "Employee Hardship Funds." Employee Hardship Funds provide emergency cash to a company's workers if they face unexpected financial hardships, such as a house or apartment fire. The emergency money from the Employee Hardship Fund is not a loan and does not have to be repaid. The money in the fund comes directly from donations from the company's own workers. Before taking this survey, had you ever heard of Employee Hardship Funds?"] By way of comparison, in a separate, Fall 2022 survey of frontline workers in five industries (including retail), @WERNsurvey2023 asked respondents about programs and benefits available at their main job using the same list of job amenities.  Twelve percent (12%) of that sample and 13% of retail workers reported that their employer had an emergency cash grant program [@ahlquistVoiceJobYounger2023; @ahlquistWERNWorkersSurvey2023].^[Note that, in Study 1, we are unable to confirm the accuracy of respondents' reports about their employers' EHFs, so these quantities represent beliefs only.]  

For evidence on H2, I presented Study 1 respondents with a list of six large retail employers and asked them to indicate whether they believed each had an EHF.^[The employers were Costco (no), Disney (yes), Home Depot (yes), Kohl's (yes), Starbucks (yes), Walmart (yes).]  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-beliefs) displays the distribution of responses across all firms, broken out by whether the respondent believes their current retail employer has an EHF.

  )

```

Regardless of current EHF exposure, large majorities confessed ignorance as to large retail employers' EHF programs.  Contrary to @besleyCompetitionIncentivesMotivated2005, this suggests that EHFs are not currently used to attract "mission-oriented" or "value-aligned" workers.  Nevertheless, respondents who report an EHF at their current job are less likely to express ignorance and much more likely to offer the (correct) EHF response for the Home Depot and, especially, Walmart.  Overall, retail workers do not seem to find EHFs at the largest employers particularly salient.

## Interest and preferences over EHFs

Notwithstanding their limited awareness of existing EHF programs, respondents were remarkably supportive of EHFs after the programs were explained, preferring a program in which workers have some voice.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-support) displays levels of support for an EHF.  When asked, large majorities report "extreme" support for an EHF, with those who already have such a program showing even stronger support than those asked to consider a hypothetical program, with `r round(100*support_sum$prop[1])`% "extremely" supportive against `r round(100*support_sum$prop[4])`%.  When asked about a willingness to donate to the EHF, `r round(100*genpop_engage_sum$donte_new)`% would donate, with a modal response of a "regular donation less than \$20".  

```{r fig-genpop-support, fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", fig.cap="Support for creating or maintaining  an EHF"}
ehf_support_genpop
```

I went on to ask respondents to consider a hypothetical job with another retailer that paid the same wages as their current job, has a 10 minute longer commute, but better amenities.^[I focused on difference in commute time rather than a difference in hourly wage rates because shift availability and scheduling practices are highly variable within and across retailers [@harknettImprovingHealthEconomic2021;@schneiderHardTimesRoutine2021].  At the median hourly wage among survey respondents, the additional commute time implies giving up `r paste("$",round(1/3*genpop_engage_sum$wage_med,2), sep="")` in earnings per round trip to work.]  I asked how seriously they would consider the new job depending on which amenity was better.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-prefs) displays the responses.  Among the amenities offered, "emergency cash offered during hard times" was second only to paid time off in terms of the proportion of respondents saying they would take the new job "very seriously."  EHF programs appear notably more attractive to workers than parental leave or union representation.   

```{r fig-genpop-prefs, fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", fig.cap="Preferences over job amenities"}
amenity_plot_w_gp
```

Finally, I asked respondents who did not report having an EHF how much control workers _should_ have if their employer launched such a program.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-control) indicates that large majorities preferred an EHF arrangement in which workers have a voice in running the fund, consistent with prior work showing strong latent demand among US workers for more influence over the terms and conditions of work [@mazumderWhatAmericansWant2024; @kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019].  The modal response is a shared governance model with input from both the employer and workers.

```{r fig-genpop-control, fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", fig.cap="Preferences worker voice in the EHF"}
genpop_ehf_cntrl
```

Study 1 indicates that EHFs are not widely widely known across retail employers, but they receive strong support and can be attractive amenities to retail workers.  Workers prefer EHFs in which they share control with management.

# Studies 2 \& 3
## Case selection

Studies 2 and 3 focus on workers at two "big box" US retailers with well-established EHF programs, The Home Depot and Walmart, respectively.  These firms compete to some degree in both product and labor markets and both have seen union activism. They are extremely large employers, which makes recruiting a survey sample feasible.   By concentrating on two specific firms I can address detailed questions about EHF awareness and engagement as well as conduct survey-based experiments tailored to specific programs.  The differences between the firms and their EHFs are potentially instructive about variation in EHF effects.   

The Home Depot operates nationwide and reported 418,000 "associates" in the US in 2022 [@thehomedepot2022AnnualReport2023].  The Home Depot's EHF--The Homer Fund--is managed in-house and has been in continuous operation since 1999.  The Homer Fund is among the most generous EHFs, with a maximum grant amount of \$10,000, eligibility from the first day of employment, and the ability to apply repeatedly (conditional on a qualifying event).  The Homer Fund is sizable, reporting disbursements of \$21.2 million to over 12,000 workers in the 2022 fiscal year [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023].  The fund claims to have disbursed \$230 million to 164,000 employees between 1999 and 2022.  Importantly, the Home Depot aggressively promotes the Homer Fund to encourage both worker donations and engagement.  The Homer Fund has a dedicated website and YouTube channel with numerous professional-quality testimonial videos, along with active social media accounts aimed at workers.  The Home Depot runs regular donation drives in which different stores compete with one another to generate donations to the EHF.  The Homer Fund prides itself on worker participation, claiming that a "majority of contributions" come from associates.^[[https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0](https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0)]  

The Home Depot is clearly not representative of all firms or even all firms that maintain EHFs.  It is larger, its EHF is older, and Home Depot puts considerable promotional effort behind the Homer Fund.  The Home Depot is widely viewed as among the better retail employers, fostering a culture of both teamwork and expertise around home improvement and construction [@charanHomeDepotsBlueprint2006].  Using Glassdoor postings and NLP tools to describe several dimensions of corporate culture, @sullMeasuringCultureLeading2019 rank the Home Depot at the 77th percentile in "collaboration" and the 48th percentile in "respect" across all firms, the latter among the top ten in the general and specialty retail categories.^["Collaboration" is defined as "employees work well together within their teams and across different parts of the organization."  "Respect" is "employees demonstrate consideration and courtesy for others, and treat each other with dignity."  Rankings available here: https://sloanreview.mit.edu/culture500/comparison?companies=c175,c738&cv=respect ] In interviews, several EHF practitioners pointed to the Home Depot as exemplary in its EHF promotion activities, incentives, and integration with broader worker support programs and corporate philanthropy.  Interviews also suggested that worker awareness and engagement at the Home Depot likely approaches the upper bound of what is achievable among large retail employers. I therefore view the Home Depot as a "most likely case" in which to observe an EHF effect [@georgeCaseStudiesTheory2005].

As with the Homer Fund, Walmart's ACNT Together Fund is over 20 years old and managed in-house.  The EHF is available to both full- and part-time workers who have been at Walmart for at least 90 days.^[Based on a retail industry monthly separation rate of 4% [@usbureauoflaborstatisticsJobOpeningLabor2025], I expect about 12% of new Walmart hires to leave before becoming eligible to apply for an ACNT grant.] But the ACNT is substantially less generous than the Homer Fund, with a maximum grant of \$1500 in a rolling 5-year period. The ACNT Together Fund has minimal presence on social media and there is no evidence of any donation drives or promotional efforts similar to those at the Home Depot.^[Interestingly, Walmart matches employee donations to the Walmart political action committee 2:1 with corporate donations to the Together Fund. In 2015, the Federal Election Commission rejected a challenge to this practice.  In our sample, fewer than 1% of respondents reported making a contribution to the Walmart PAC.]    

More generally, Walmart is known not as "high road" employer but rather for a culture of aggressive cost control [@cascioDecencyMeansMore2006; @wartzmanStillBrokeWalmarts2022]. @sullMeasuringCultureLeading2019 reported Walmart's corporate culture around "respect" at the 15th percentile and "collaboration" at the 37th percentile, both considerably lower than the Home Depot.  Walmart is thus a case where the EHF is less generous, less promoted, and where the rhetoric of care and mutual aid appears less consistent with workers' other experiences on the job.  Under H4 we expect that EHF effects at Walmart will be weaker than those at the Home Depot.  

## The samples and survey

To independently construct matched worker-employer survey samples, I follow @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 and recruit participants using ads on the Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads) targeted at users 18 and older with Meta-reported status as Home Depot and Walmart employees, respectively.  Those completing the survey were offered entry into a raffle for a free iPad Mini or Visa gift card.  @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 show that this strategy has considerable promise, producing accurate estimates of the employee population in the retail industry.  But the Facebook strategy has the obvious drawback of potentially biased sample selection.  Although selection concerns are unavoidable to some degree,  I follow @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019 and construct raking weights using the Facebook-reported gender and age distributions for Facebook/Instagram users who report employment at the Home Depot and Walmart, respectively.  @growFacebookAdvertisingDataforthcoming show that Facebook-reported age and gender appear quite accurate. I use raking weights when reporting descriptive quantities, but unweighted data when analyzing the survey experiment.

Survey recruitment for the Home Depot sample occurred between 7 September and 15 October 2021.  In the end, 515 individuals completed the survey, passed an attention check, and confirmed their Home Depot employment status.  The Walmart survey was in the field from October 23 to December 4, 2024 and produced `r nrow(wmt.hq)` complete responses that passed similar screening and attention checks.  Summary statistics for all variables by treatment condition appear in Appendices \@ref(app-survsum-uw), \@ref(app-survsum-w), and \@ref(app-wmt-survsum).

The surveys in Studies 2 and 3 were very similar in question wording and ordering, but Study 3 included several extensions discussed below. Study 3 included a specific question about quit intentions; Study 3 included a behavioral measure of donation to the EHF (clicking on a link to a donation page); we expanded the EHF survey experiment by including a placebo condition; and we sent a follow-up survey one week after survey completion to respondents who opted in to the incentive raffle.^[Respondents were sent emails inviting them into the follow-up survey, offering them a second entry into the raffle for follow-up completion.  Respondents were contacted a maximum of three times. We received valid followup responses from `r sum(!is.na(wmt.hq$age_f))` or `r round(100*sum(!is.na(wmt.hq$age_f)) /nrow(wmt.hq))`% of those completing the main survey.]

aware_donate_xt <- svytable(~EHF_aware_list + HF_donate, THD_comp, round=T)
```

As my preferred measure of Homer Fund awareness, I use the same strategy as in Study 1 in which respondents select "cash grants to help in times of emergency" from a list of eight work-related benefits or programs.^[I discuss two other indicators of awareness and compare them with the preferred "list" measure in Appendix \@ref(app-HFaware).]  This pre-treatment measure of EHF awareness is available for all survey respondents without contaminating the survey experiment.  I find that `r 100*round(aware_tab$aware.prop.l,2)`% (se = `r 100*round(aware_tab$aware.prop.l_se,2)`%) were aware of a cash grant program at the Home Depot.  

As indicators of engagement, we asked whether respondents had donated to, applied to, received money from, and know personally someone who has received money from the EHF.^[The donation and grant receipt questions were asked of all respondents while the applied and "know someone" questions were asked only of treatment group respondents, post-treatment.]     A remarkable `r round(100*aware_tab$donated.prop,1)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab$donated.prop_se,1)`%) of respondents reported that they had donated.  But approximately 30% of the respondents indicating past donation fail to identify emergency cash grants as a benefit their employer offers.  I find that `r round(100*aware_tab$know.prop,1)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab$know.prop_se,1)`%) claim to know someone who has gotten money from the program. 

Application and grant receipt estimates are also quite high.  We find that, respectively, `r round(100*aware_tab$applied.prop)`% and  `r round(100*aware_tab$received.prop)`% applied for and received EHF grants.  Survey self-reports indicate that `r round(100*aware_tab$eligible.prop)`% experienced an event in the last 12 months that would make them potentially eligible for and Homer Fund grant.  Of that group, `r round(100*takeup$takeup.prop)`% applied to the Homer Fund.  Compared to the general retail population in Study 1, EHF awareness among Home Depot workers is quite high.  Consistent with the messaging around the Homer Fund donation drives, it appears that Home Depot workers are aware of a charitable endeavor that relates to their coworkers.  But worker awareness of the program's _benefit_ function appears relatively thin.  

To explore the predictors of EHF awareness and engagement, we fit weighted logistic regression models, including age, gender, tenure at the firm^[In measuring firm tenure, respondents could choose among \{less than 6 months, 6-12 months, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, 3+ years\}.  I enter this variable in minimum months of tenure, \{0,6,12,24,36\} in the regression models for ease of exposition.  Entering as dummy variables or ordered categories does not affect inference or appreciably improve model fit.], race (white/nonwhite), and education (college/no college) as covariates.  We also include indicators for whether the Home Depot job is the respondent's main job, whether this job paid on an hourly basis, and whether it's full time.  Coefficient estimates and standard errors appear in Table \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model).  

Once we condition on multiple covariates, tenure at the Home Depot is the only predictor with a relatively precisely estimated relationship across all indicators of awareness and engagement in the expected positive direction.  Full-time workers are also more likely to report awareness of a cash grant program but these estimates are less-precise. Tenure and full-time status are closely related: over 72% of the respondents with tenure over 3 years work full time against less than 50% for those with less than 3 years at the firm.  Other worker attributes appear to have little relationship with EHF awareness. Older workers are slightly more likely to donate and less likely to receive grants whereas men are less likely to apply to the EHF or know other recipients.

### ACNT

Measuring EHF awareness and engagement in Study 3 mirrored that from Study 2.
```{r ACNT-aware-calcs, echo=FALSE}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '6_awareness_models_plots_WMT.R')

rm(temp)

aware_tab_wmt<-summarise(wmt.hq_wgt_f, 
          aware.prop = survey_mean(emerg_assist_benefits=="Yes"),
          aware.prop.direct = survey_mean(ehf_exist == "Yes"),
          know.prop = survey_mean(ehf_other_recip=="Yes", na.rm=T),
          applied.prop = survey_mean(ehf_applied=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         received.prop = survey_mean(ehf_received_all=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         donated.prop = survey_mean(ehf_donation=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         eligible.prop = survey_mean(emergency=="Yes", na.rm=T),
          )
takeup_wmt <- wmt.hq_wgt_f |> 
  filter(ehf_exist != "No", treatment_bin == FALSE, emergency == "Yes") |> 
  summarize(takeup.prop = survey_mean(ehf_applied == "Yes"))

cntlaware_wmt <- wmt.hq_wgt_f |> 
  filter(treatment_bin == FALSE) |> 
  summarize(aware.prop.direct.cntrl = survey_mean(ehf_exist == "Yes"))


```

As expected, EHF awareness and engagement is substantially lower among the Walmart sample than among the Home Depot workers. We find that `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$aware.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$aware.prop_se)`%) were aware of the ACNT. Of those who both knew about the ACNT _and_ experienced a qualifying event, `r round(100*takeup_wmt$takeup.prop)`% applied for a grant.  `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$know.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$know.prop_se)`%) claim to know a grant recipient and `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$donated.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$donated.prop_se)`%)  claim to have donated.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model-wmt) presents regression results for the correlates of awareness and engagement.  As with the Home Depot results, job tenure at Walmart remains the consistent important predictor of EHF awareness, even though job tenure in the Walmart sample is shorter than for the Home Depot.^[The median Walmart respondent had been employed at Walmart between 2 and 3 years whereas the median Home Depot respondent had been with the Home Depot for over 3 years.]  Several echo the Home Depot survey, but are stronger or more precisely estimated.  Theres is a more pronounced gender difference among the Walmart sample, with men significantly less aware and engaged with the ACNT.  Hourly workers are considerably more likely to apply but less likely to donate to the ACNT.

## EHF experiments

In both studies 2 and 3, I included experiments that randomly exposed respondents to messages about their employer's EHF to test H1, H3, and H4. 

### Study 2 experiment

The experiment in Study 2 consisted of a control condition and two treatment arms, referred to as the _text_ and _video_ treatments, respectively.  Respondents in the control arm saw no prompt or mention of the EHF.  

Those in the text treatment saw the following statement about their employer's EHF:

> Your employer, The Home Depot, maintains a program called the Homer Fund.   The Homer Fund combines donations from workers like you with money from The Home Depot corporation.  The Homer Fund uses this money to offer cash grants of up to $10,000 to Home Depot employees in times of unexpected financial hardship like a natural disaster, illness, or death in the family.

Brief, neutral textual descriptions do not reflect how employers actually communicate with their employees.  Fortunately, the Home Depot maintains a YouTube channel that includes high-quality video testimonials from purported Homer Fund grant recipients. Study 2 respondents in the video treatment were asked to watch the video displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray).^[The video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe) and here: [https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story](https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story).  The summary text appearing on the Home Depot website is: "When Ray, a retired Army veteran and proud Home Depot associate, fell severely ill, his family needed help covering expenses such as food and gas. With the help the Homer Fund and his fellow associates’ generosity, he and his family were able to recover. The Homer Fund, a nonprofit exclusively for Home Depot associates, celebrates 20 years of giving in 2019. Established by our co-founders Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank and Ken Langone, it has awarded $176 million to more than 138,000 Home Depot families facing unforeseen hardships. For Ray and his family, The Fund’s help came at a critical time. Ray spent six weeks in an induced coma. The Homer Fund stepped in to help his family secure necessities so they could focus their energy on Ray’s recovery. The Fund’s impact on Ray’s family reminded him of the comradery of his Army days. 'You know you have a brother and sister to your left or to your right. And you look out for them and they look out for you,' Ray says."  This text was not presented to survey respondents, but is presented here to provide a summary of video contents.  The video was 2:41 in length.]   Immediately following the experimental treatment, Respondents answered a series of questions designed to measure subjective financial well-being, attachment to co-workers, attachment to their employer, and willingness to for vote for unionization.

#### Analytic approach

The main quantities of interest are the average treatment effect (ATE) for each of the two EHF treatments relative to control for each of the outcome variables.  I present graphical displays as well as regression-based estimates.  I then look for heterogeneity in treatment effects, depending on whether the respondent was aware of the EHF program before the survey experiment.

Workers previously unaware of the program may be more responsive to the treatments than those who knew about the EHF prior to the survey ("pre-exposed").^[I will use the terms "aware" and "pre-exposed" interchangeably.]  To the extent we are interested in the effect of informing a previously uniformed worker about the EHF, the ATEs could be subject to "pre-exposure bias" [@druckmanLearningMorePolitical2012a; @ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023].  Alternatively, we can view the ATEs as the expected shift in opinion, averaged across all workers, a meaningful quantity in itself.  But estimating the effect among the un-exposed remains important for understanding how workers might respond to EHF messages.  

By measuring EHF awareness before encountering the treatment, we can estimate heterogenous treatment effect by pre-exposure status.  The assumption needed to sustain a causal interpretation is that pre-exposure to information about the EHF is independent of potential outcomes, conditional on treatment and relevant pre-treatment covariates.^[Pre-exposure can also be viewed through the lens of compliance with treatment assignment; the pre-exposed are "always takers" while the un-exposed are "compliers".  Since we have direct measures of pre-exposure, however, the heterogeneous effects approach is more natural.]
 For outcome $j$, the relevant heterogeneous effects can be estimated using the following approach: 
\begin{equation}
E[Y_{ij}] = f(\alpha + \beta_1 T_i + \beta_2 V_i + \beta_3 P_i + \beta_4 T_iP_i + \beta_5 V_iP_i + \beta_6 X_i)
(\#eq:reg)
\end{equation}
where $T_i$ and $V_i$ denote text and video treatments, respectively, and $P_i$ denotes whether $i$ is coded as pre-exposed to her employer's EHF. If $f(x) = x$, then we can estimate \@ref(eq:reg) using OLS, in which case $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the "average information effects" [@ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023], i.e., the effects of the text and video treatments, respectively, among those who were previously unexposed.  The quantities $(\beta_1+\beta_4)$ and $(\beta_2+\beta_5)$ represent the text and video treatment effects among those who were aware of the EHF prior to the survey experiment. In the analysis that follows, I report three models for each outcome: one that includes only the experimental treatment indicators, one that adds a treatment-by-awareness interaction term, and a third that also includes a suite of covariates.^[Full reporting of the coefficient estimates appears in Appendix \@ref(app-cov)]  In analyzing the survey experiment, I report estimates from unweighted regressions.

One might object that the measurement of EHF awareness is itself a form of priming or pre-exposure in the survey. There are three reasons why this is not a serious concern here.  First, as I described above, the elicitation of EHF awareness is subtle, embedded in longer list of potential job benefits, and avoids using the program's name.  The risk of actual priming is low.  Second, if there were a meaningful priming effect from the EHF awareness question, we would expect to see minimal differences between the aware and un-aware.  This is not what we observe below. The pre-exposed Study 2 respondents are systematically different in terms of mean outcome levels and treatment effects from the un-exposed.  Third, to the extent that there is a priming or contamination from the EHF awareness question, it would reduce any detectable treatment effects or differences between the aware and unaware respondents. Thus my estimates are, if anything, downward biased and my conclusions are conservative.

#### Results

##### Financial insecurity

Our indicator of subjective financial is the standard question from the Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making, asking whether a respondent could cover a $400 emergency expense.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-finsec) displays the weighted distribution of responses by treatment condition.  The upper panel reports the full distribution of the Likert scale for the response whereas the lower panel dichotomizes the variable based on whether the respondent was able or unable to cover the expense.  Vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals.  

```{r fig-finsec, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subjective financial security (weighted)"}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '4_insecurity_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
p.ord
```

Three findings emerge.  First, just under 40% of Home Depot respondents expressed concern about their ability to meet this financial challenge, in line with recent estimates [@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemEconomicWellBeingHouseholds2023].  Second, to the extent the EHF treatment had any effects at all, it is concentrated in the video treatment and the direction is contrary to H1.  Respondents in the video treatment felt _less_ financially secure than those in the control or text treatment arms.  Third, none of these treatment effects were distinguishable from 0 at conventional thresholds for inference.  

Table \@ref(tab:tab-finsec) presents regression results that mirror the graphical displays.  In particular, I find no evidence of any treatment effects, regardless of pre-exposure status. I do, however, find that respondents who reported awareness of the program prior to the experiment were also more sanguine about their financial security, even after conditioning on tenure at the Home Depot. On average their self report is higher than the unaware by about 0.5 standard deviations or half the average distance between outcome categories.  Although this higher level of reported security among the pre-exposed is consistent with the EHF's improving financial security, the lack of any detectable treatment effects among the un-exposed militates against this interpretation, as we will see below.  In Appendix \@ref(app-bills), I also examine an alternative outcome: the self-reported difficulty in covering monthly bills. Analysis of this secondary outcome are consistent with the those in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-finsec): presenting Home Depot employees with information about their employer's EHF, even a somewhat heavy-handed corporate promotional video, has no effect on their subjective financial security.

```

##### Job attachment

Even if EHFs do not improve feelings of financial security, they may affect worker attachment to one another and the employer.  We presented respondents with a series of questions on this topic.  Following @freemanSharedCapitalismWork2010, we asked respondents to report how loyal they felt toward their co-workers and their employer, with responses in four categories ranging from "none at all" to "a lot".  We also asked respondents how willing they would be to recommend their employer to a friend as a place to work.  For brevity, we combine all these indicators into a single job attachment index by taking the first principle component of all three questions, oriented so that high values indicate greater attachment.^[Results for individual items appear in Appendix \@ref(app-HFattachment).  Treatment effects are similar across each component of the index.] 

```{r fig-attachment-plot-thd, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Treatment effects on job attachment"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '5_loyalty_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
p.ai_thd
```

Table \@ref(tab:tab-aithd-models) uses OLS regression to estimate treatment effects, including models that adjust for covariates and pre-exposure.  On average, the text treatment had no detectable effect, but the video treatment increased average job attachment by 0.5 on the principal components scale, or about 30%  of a control group standard deviation.  We also uncover important heterogeneity by pre-exposure status.  Those pre-exposed to the EHF were significantly more positive about their Home Depot job than the un-exposed by about 2/3 of a standard deviation, even accounting for predictors of EHF awarebess. In contrast to findings for financial security, we recover positive and significant treatment effects for job attachment.  EHF treatment effects are  concentrated almost entirely among those unaware of the EHF before the survey, with treatment effects among those already aware of the Homer Fund indistinguishable from zero.

```

To see the heterogeneous effects more clearly, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-THD-effattach) displays average predicted outcomes by treatment and pre-exposure status. Among the unaware, the text treatment produced a positive and marginally significant treatment effect and the video treatment elicited a significant effect on the order of 0.6 standard deviations.  Among the pre-exposed the treatment effects vanish.  A simple informational prompt about an EHF has little impact on job attachment.  The more intensive video produces a marked increase in attachment among those unaware of the EHF coming in to the survey.

```

##### Unionization

In measuring support for unionization, respondents answered the standard union vote question:  "If an election were held today to decide whether employees like you should be represented by a union at The Home Depot, would you vote for the union or against the union?"  Respondents could answer \{yes, no, not sure\}.    The distribution of responses to both questions by EHF treatment is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uvui).

```{r fig-uvui,eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Support for unions and unemployment insurance (weighted)"}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '7_uiuv_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

```

We see that workers in this sample are generally skeptical of unions, with `r 100*round(summary_tab_uw_c$prounion,2)`%  of control respondents reporting a willingness to vote for a union and `r 100*round(summary_tab_uw_c$antiunion,2)`% voting against (the remainder answered "not sure").  This level of union support is substantially lower than recent estimates among front line retail workers.^[In Study 1, we found that `r round(100*genpop_engage_sum$union_support)`% would vote for a union and `r round(100*genpop_engage_sum$union_oppose)`% against.  @ahlquistVoiceJobYounger2023; @WERNsurvey2023 find that 36% of retail workers would vote for the union and 26% would vote against.]  There are, however, a substantial portion of undecided workers, the modal response among the video treatment group.  

Turning to treatment effects, we see some surprising results.  First, echoing findings for the attachment questions, we find no evidence that the text treatment has any average effect at all.  Second, we find that the video treatment again moves respondents' opinions.  On average, the video treatment makes respondents more _uncertain_ about their support for unionization.  The fact that respondents chose to answer the question (as opposed to skipping it) suggests that the video treatment actually increased uncertainty, as opposed to respondent disinterest.

Given the importance of all three outcome categories, I report multinomial logit results in table \@ref(tab:tab-uv).  In the base model we see that video treatment, on average, produces an increase in the "not sure" responses, echoing Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uvui).  But accounting for pre-exposure status in a regression framework is particularly illuminating for this outcome.  Those aware of the EHF prior to the experiment were significantly less supportive of unions than the unexposed.   Among the unexposed, we see that both the text and video treatments reduce support for unionization, although only the video treatment effect crosses conventional significance thresholds.

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uveff) provides a graphical interpretation of treatment effects by pre-exposure status.  The left column displays the predicted outcomes by treatment status for those who were not aware of the EHF before the survey.  This right column displays the same quantities for those already aware of the EHF.  On the left, we clearly see that the treatments, especially the video version, reduce support for unionization. Predicted union support among the unaware respondents in the video treatment is effectively identical to that among respondents already aware of the EHF prior to the survey.  But rather than increasing opposition to unionization, the video treatment makes the unaware respondents more unsure.  In the right hand column we see that the video treatment actually reduces opposition to unionization among those who were already aware of the EHF.  But, again, this effect comes from an increase the "not sure" responses.  Overall, we see evidence consistent with the idea that EHFs reduce support for unionization, largely by increasing uncertainty or apathy as opposed to encouraging opposition.

### Study 3 experiment 

Based on results from the Home Depot survey, Study 3 eliminated the neutral text treatment and concentrates on a video vignette treatment for the Walmart sample.  Unfortunately, Walmart does not produce video or other testimonials about the ACNT.

To construct a comparable treatment for the Walmart sample, I produced an original video using the Homer Fund video as a script and audio-visual template.  We adapted the video to the Walmart context and used a paid actor.^[The paid actor exhibited the same gender (male) and racial (white) expression as in the Homer Fund video.  The actor was also viewed as approximately the same age as the spokesperson in the Homer Fund video, according to mTurk coders. The ACNT-adapted video was 41 seconds shorter than the Homer Fund video.  We achieved this by shortening or removing some interstitial and panning shots, not through any reduction in the spoken script beyond those parts that were only relevant to the Home Depot.  The video included text indicating that the speaker was an actor at the beginning of the video.]  For Study 3, I also created a placebo video to address concerns that findings from Study 2 might be a "video effect", as opposed to an EHF effect.  Respondents in the placebo condition watched a video in which the same hired actor read a Walmart press release about the company's acquisition of Vizio.    

In Study 3, Respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to either treatment or control.  Within the control condition, respondents were randomly divided between the pure control and the placebo conditions.  The pure controls saw no additional information, just as in Study 2.^[I also pre-registered a framing study, in which I slightly vary the framing of the treatment video.  Specifically, the "card" visible on the screen before the respondent clicks "play" differs, with the _solidarity_ framing displaying text emphasizing supporting other Walmart workers and the and the _charity_ framing displaying text emphasizing charitable donations to help those in need. The content of the video vignette was otherwise identical across treatment groups.  As there was no detectable difference between these framings, I do not report on this in the main text.  Regression results demonstrating this for key outcomes appears in appendix [cite appendix].]  

Manipulation checks (see Appendix \@ref(app-manip-wmt)) confirm that the video treatment did indeed increase respondent awareness of the ACNT, as expected whereas the placebo had no effect. Study 3 also included a behavioral indicator of ACNT donation willingness.^[At the end of the survey, respondents had the opportunity to click on a link where they could donate to the ACNT.  We know only whether a respondent clicked the link.] Consistent with @andreoniPowerAskingHow2011, those in the video treatment were four percentage points (or 35\%, $p < 0.05$) more likely to click on the donation link (see Appendix \@ref(app-donate-wmt)).  There were no detectable differences between pure control and placebo groups in either manipulation check.  Thus we display results for binary treatment/control in the analysis below.  Based on the findings in the Home Depot sample, we pre-registered a plan to examine whether treatment effects differ based on pre-exposure to the ACNT, measured using the same question format as in the Home Depot survey. 

### Financial security and job attachment

```{r}
ee.prop<-summarise(wmt.hq_wgt_f, 
          survey_mean(emergency_expense_num >0.5))
```

Respondents in the Walmart sample were notably more pessimistic about their financial security than in the Home Depot sample, with `r round(100*(1-ee.prop$coef))`% expressing concern about their ability to meet a \$400 emergency expense.  This is also consistent with respondents' lived experiences: 35% of the Walmart sample reported accessing government welfare programs in the last year, against just 20% for Home Depot workers.     

Table \@ref(tab:tab-finsec-wmt) displays OLS regression-based estimates of treatment effects. Those pre-exposed to the ACNT are more confident in their ability to meet a small financial emergency, even after conditioning on predictors of EHF awareness.  But, just as with the Home Depot workers, we fail to detect any EHF treatment effects on Walmart worker's subjective financial security.     

```{r tab-finsec-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Financial Security (Walmart)"}

#temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '7_attachment_summary_plots_WMT.R')
#source(temp)
#rm(temp)
```

In addition to feeling more financially precarious, Walmart respondents were less supportive of Walmart as an employer, compared to the Home Depot workers.  For example, the net promoter score among the Walmart control respondents was `r 100*round(nps[[1]],2)`%, seven percentage points lower than at the Home Depot.^[Net promoter score is % promoters - % detractors for the recommend employer question, a common indicator of aggregate support.]  This suggests that Walmart workers are coming in to the survey with a more negative set of experiences and expectations about their employer than the Home Depot sample.  

To analyze treatment effects on job attachment, I again construct a job attachment index using a principal components analysis of the four questions around workplace attachment, scaled so that larger values indicate greater attachment.^[The questions were loyalty to coworkers, loyalty to employer, willingness to recommend employer, and quit intentions (reverse coded).  The first principal component captured 65% of the variation across these variables.  Note that this attachment index differs from the Home Depot in the inclusion of quit intentions.  Analyzing quit intentions separately has no effect on our conclusions.]  I then use the first principal component as the attachment index; analyzing the individual components separately does not alter qualitative conclusions.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-attachment-models-wmt) summarizes findings. As in Study 2, we continue to see that those pre-exposed to the EHF are more attached to their jobs, even after conditioning on predictors of EHF awareness. But experimental findings around the ACNT differ: the video treatment has small positive effect that is indistinguishable from zero at conventional thresholds.  There is no evidence of heterogeneous effects by pre-exposure to the EHF.

<!---
In the Walmart sample, we also asked respondents about a hypothetical job offer at another retailer with better amenities, following the same pattern as in Study 1.  In Table \@ref(), we look at treatment effects from the survey experiment on how seriously the respondent would consider a job that offered "emergency cash assistance in hard times" a respondent places on

### Attitudes towards unionization

In the Walmart survey we again look for treatment effects on attitudes toward unionization.  Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv-models-wmt) displays results for a multinomial logistic regression on willingness to vote for unionization.  Contrary to findings in Study 2, the EHF video treatment induces a modest _reduction in opposition_ to unionization among the Walmart sample.  Also contrary to findings from Home Depot workers, I find no evidence of any difference in union support due to prior awareness of the ACNT.  I therefore use the "covariate" model to produce effect estimates for interpretive purposes.   

```{r tab-uv-models-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Support for unionization (Walmart)"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '12_uv_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
multinom_tab_wmt
```

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uv-models-wmt) displays the estimated average shift in the probability of choosing each of the outcome categories by treatment status.  On average, the ACNT video lowered the probability of voting against the union by almost 5 percentage points; this substantively large, given a 21% rate of anti-union voting among the control group respondents.  Unlike the Home Depot sample, the pro-union vote absorbed most of this treatment effect.

In Study 3, we also asked respondents to use a slider to indicate what percent of their co-workers they expected to vote in favor of unionization.  Table \@ref(tab:tab-usupp-models-wmt) displays the regression-estimated treatment effects.  The video treatment induces a four percentage point average increase in the expected percentage, off of a baseline average of 50%, a modest but relatively precisely estimated effect.  The ACNT video appears to

# Discussion 

## Descriptive conclusions

In Study 1 we saw that retail workers are generally unaware of the EHFs and show limited knowledge about which employers offer these programs, suggesting that EHFs have not become a significant tool for recruiting and retaining retail workers.  On the other hand, the low cost and ubiquity of EHFs in retail may indicate that in equilibrium all larger employers offer EHFs and workers rationally don't pay much attention to the specifics.  But the fact that respondents show strong interest in EHF programs after being told about them suggests that this interpretation is unlikely.  Retail workers appear to value emergency support, at least in the abstract.  And, given the choice, they would prefer workers to have some voice over the program's operation.

## Research hypotheses

Two different surveys among Home Depot and Walmart workers present consistent as well as mixed findings around our research hypotheses.  These findings are difficult to reconcile with an overarching theory of EHFs or "private welfare," but, I will argue, they are consistent with differences across EHF programs, corporate cultures, and worker populations.   

Across both surveys, we found that workers aware of their employers' EHFs before the survey were, in fact, more attached to their jobs, felt more financially stable, and were less likely to support unionization, even after conditioning on predictors of pre-exposure such as job tenure.  But this does not warrant a causal interpretation, as the causal arrow between EHF awareness and job tenure could go either way or be the result of some omitted factor.  When using a survey experiment that exploits actual employer messages to workers around EHFs, we saw that these messages produced no effect on either subjective financial security or support for public social assistance programs in both surveys, contrary to the programs' stated intent and the "substitution hypothesis", respectively.

There were two notable differences in treatment effects between Study 2 and Study 3.  Among the Home Depot population, the video treatment substantially increased job attachment and increased uncertainty around unionization by reducing support, consistent with the research hypotheses.  Both effects were concentrated among respondents who were unaware of the EHF prior to the survey, as expected.  In Study 3 among Walmart workers, the EHF video had no detectable effect on job attachment and _reduced_ opposition to unionization while increasing the proportion of workers that respondents believed would support unionization.  The video treatment increased the likelihood that a respondent would click a link to donate to the ACNT.  None of these effects varied based on pre-exposure to the program.   

These contrary findings suggest that the effect of EHF programs and messages depend on the nature of the program itself as well as context, including other corporate practices and signals about corporate culture.  The Homer Fund is considerably more visible and generous, embedded in a significant CSR and internal promotional apparatus. Home Depot workers held more favorable attitudes towards their employer and were already more likely to engage with the EHF prior to the survey experiment.  Consequently, the EHF treatment appears to have reinforced an existing set of attitudes and dispositions, making those who were unaware of the program "look more like" already-informed Home Depot workers in their attitudes.  When looking at Walmart, it seems that an EHF program with less organizational support and visibility does not "make up the difference" in worker attachment between a "strong culture, low turnover" employer like the Home Depot and a "weak culture, high turnover" employer such as Walmart.   

# Conclusion

Employers have tremendous leeway to introduce or modify benefit plans and workplace programs that may influence workers perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors including around actions like unionization. EHFs are one such tax-incentivized program that has received virtually no systematic study.  This oversight is all the more remarkable as EHFs clearly echo both an earlier era of welfare capitalism and past mutual aid initiatives that produced and modern labor unions.

This paper provides the first systematic glimpse into EHFs in US retail, an industry that employs tens of millions but that is also known for low wages and elevated levels of worker churn and activism in the post-COVID period.  Using original surveys, I find that between 13% and 30% of retail workers report having an EHF at their current job.  When asked about EHFs at major retail employers, worker knowledge is limited, suggesting that EHFs have not become a significant tool for recruiting and retaining retail workers. Nevertheless, when the programs are explained, workers show strong support for them, including valuing them as highly as improved health insurance benefits when considering a hypothetical job offer.  EHFs do seem to address a real need. 

To better ground these findings in specific employer contexts, I used social media to recruit survey respondents who work at two large US retailers with well-established, in-house EHFs: the Home Depot and Walmart.  These firms have much in common, but their EHFs differ. The Home Depot EHF is substantially more generous and more heavily promoted as part of corporate events, CSR, and training. Consistent with these differences, I found that worker awareness at the Home Depot exceeded 60%, with large proportions claiming to have have donated.  Among Walmart workers, I find just over one third of workers aware of the EHF, with less than 15% claiming to have donated.  I characterized worker awareness as "broad-but-thin": workers knew of an emergency grant program, but were less clear on how it functioned and its connection to worker donations.  At both firms, awareness and other engagement with the EHF is strongly correlated with worker tenure, full-time status, and gender.  Men were less aware and engaged.

I randomly assigned respondents employer-produced video messages promoting the EHF to study the effect on subjective financial security, job attachment, donation willingness, and support for unionization and public assistance programs for the unemployed and those in temporary need.  Contrary to expectations and stated EHF goals, I found no evidence in either survey that the EHF treatments induce any improvement in workers' subjective financial security, although workers who were aware of the program before the survey experiment were systematically more positive about their financial situation.


Findings for job attachment diverged across cases.  At the Home Depot, the video treatment had the expected positive effect, consistent with past work on CSR initiatives and employee motivation and retention [@burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021].  When we disaggregated these effects, we found that the treatment effects were largely concentrated among the respondents who were unaware of the EHF before the survey.  At Walmart, we found no treatment effect on job attachment.

Looking at support for unionization, we uncovered an even starker pattern.  At the Home Depot, the video treatment caused significant decrease in support for unionization of about 10 percentage points among those unaware of the EHF before the survey, but no effect among the pre-exposed (who were more anti-union on average).  By examining the full range of outcome values, we also saw that this decrease in support for unionization came through an increase in _uncertainty_ about unions, as opposed to an increase in outright opposition.  This suggests that EHFs could be used to demobilize workers, especially newer hires, during a unionization campaign.  At Walmart, however, we found that the EHF treatment significantly reduced opposition to unionization by about four percentage points; prior knowledge of the EHF was unrelated to treatment effects. We also found that the video treatment increased Walmart workers' expectations about their co-workers willingness to vote for a union as well as likelihood of taking an action to donate to the EHF.

Taken together, these patterns are consistent with the claim---articulated by EHF managers themselves---that EHF programs serve a culture-building and retention function at relatively low cost.  Calling attention to the EHF in the context of broader CSR and team building, as the Home Depot does, has the effect of shifting opinion of newer and arguably more mobile workers in the direction of those who have been around longer.  At Walmart, however, the EHF program has enjoyed less organizational support and visibility.  I find that similar EHF messaging fails to resonate as strongly with workers.   

EHFs present a fascinating window into employer behavior and the state of the low wage labor market in the US and beyond. Future research can extend in a variety of productive directions.  One obvious area connects with consumers: do programs of this kind affect consumers' perception of corporate brands and their labor practices?  Another involves timing: are EHFs (and communication around them) more likely during periods of elevated worker leverage or union activity? Can we document and explain which firms develop EHFs?  How do companies operating across borders view and manage EHFs and similar "private welfare" initiatives?

From a policy perspective, EHFs appear to resonate with a felt need among low-wage retail workers in the US today.  But, as the Home Depot and Walmart surveys indicate, program details, context, and promotion matter for the effects they might have on the workforce.  These programs operate in the shadow of eroded public welfare institutions, yet they are funded in part by favorable tax treatment.  Are the benefits these programs provide worth the tax expenditures?  How do these programs change when workers themselves have a voice in how they are run? 

Workers value emergency aid arrangements, which coincides with the renewed emphasis on mutual aid--and other solidaristic selective incentives--as a basis for rebuilding worker solidarity [@hertel-fernandez_why_nodate; @jarley_unions_2005; @horowitz_mutualism_2021].  The development, management, and outreach around programs like EHFs provide a clear point of common interest between workers, unions, and management.  To date this possibility remains unexplored.

# Home Depot EHF awareness measures {#app-HFaware}

Control group respondents saw no information about the EHF in the survey.  One measure of HF awareness, is the proportion of control group respondents who answer "yes" to a direct question about whether their employer has an EHF.^[The exact question wording was "Some companies have programs that take donations and provide emergency cash to help workers like you through hard times. Does The Home Depot offer a program like this for workers like you?"]  On this basis, I estimate the weighted proportion of control-condition respondents who report knowing about the EHF as `r round(aware_tab$aware.prop.s,2)` (se = `r round(aware_tab$aware.prop.s_se,2)`).  The difference in estimated awareness produced by the this measure of awareness and the list approach used in the main text is striking.  Among those in the control group correctly answering "yes" to the direct question about their employer's EHF, `r round(100*aware_xt["FALSE","Yes"]/sum(aware_xt[,"Yes"]),0)`% _failed_ to identify the cash grant program as one of their job benefits whereas nearly all of those correctly choosing the cash grant program from the list of benefits also correctly answered direct question.  Consequently, I interpret the lower estimate based on the "list" question as the more accurate reflection of EHF awareness.  Using the list measure of awareness, we estimate that 58% of the control condition respondents are aware.

When we look at the percent of respondents saying they know someone who received EHF money to those identifying the cash grant program from the list of benefits, we find that `r round(100*aware_know_xt["FALSE","Yes"]/sum(aware_know_xt[,"Yes"]),0)`% _failed_ to identify the cash grant program as one of their job benefits.

These indicate that knowledge of the Homer Fund was "broad but thin"

At the end of Study 3, respondents had the opportunity to click on a link to take them to a page where they could donate to the ACNT. Based on past research [@andreoniPowerAskingHow2011], we expect those exposed to the emotional appeal in the video to be more willing to donate.  

In the Walmart sample, we see a low baseline willingness to click on the link of `r round(100*donation_summary$prop[1])`%.  Nevertheless, those seeing the EHF video were about 4 percentage points more likely to take an action to donate. Table \@ref(tab:tab-donate-models-wmt) presents regression-based estimates.
