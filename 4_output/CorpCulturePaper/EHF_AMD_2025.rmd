\begin{abstract}
\begin{singlespace} 

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are often studied as tools of corporate governance, especially around human resources. But this literature focuses on externally-oriented CSR such as charitable donations, volunteerism, or environmental commitments.  Much less is known about CSR directed toward internal stakeholders.  This paper studies one novel and increasingly common form of inward CSR: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  Many US employers have created EHFs to distribute emergency cash to their own workers using donations pooled from among employees themselves.   This paper offers the first systematic evidence on EHFs and their effects on worker attachment. Drawing on three original, pre-registered studies I show that EHFs are popular among workers, they can foster affective attachment to employers and coworkers, and they can shift attitudes about unionization. But these effects vary in ways that reflect differences in program generosity, visibility, and alignment with corporate culture. More robust programs can strengthen employer loyalty and reduce support for unionization, while weaker efforts risk appearing insincere. The findings contribute to understanding the contingent role of CSR and private welfare initiatives as instruments of corporate governance in a precarious labor market.\\

<!---
Hundreds of US employers have created “employee hardship funds” (EHFs). EHFs pool money donations from a firm’s workers in order to offer cash grants to the firm’s employees in unforeseen emergencies. Do workers know about and engage with these programs? Do they have any impact on workers’ financial well-being or job attachment? Can they be deployed for union avoidance? I use original surveys of workers at two large employers with well-established EHFs as well as a sample of retail workers nationwide to study these questions. Retail workers have limited knowledge of these programs.  At firms with EHFs, I find “broad but thin” levels of worker awareness that reflects employer promotional effort. Using survey experiments that exploit novel video vignettes, I find mixed results: At a firm with a generous and well-promoted EHF, treatment increases worker attachment to both co-workers and the employer and increases uncertainty about unionization; these effects are concentrated among workers unaware of their employer’s EHF before the survey.  At the firm with the less generous program, I find weaker or non-existent effects, although the EHF treatment in this case reduces opposition to unionization. There is no evidence that EHFs affect workers’ perceived financial security and no evidence that EHFs "substitute" for public social insurance programs in the minds of workers.  Findings have implications for studying the "moral economy" between low-wage workers and employers in the US as well as unionization and union avoidance.  Findings also have implications for the study of charitable giving, organizational attachment, and solidarity.

 Do workers know about and engage with these programs? Can EHFs shape worker attitudes? Using three original surveys---including two matched to workers at specific employers with EHFs with embedded experiments---I find that awareness of EHFs is significant but shallow and shaped by employer promotional efforts. Among workers at a firm with a generous, well-promoted EHF, experimental treatment increases job attachment and reduces support for unionization, especially among workers previously unaware of the program. These effects are absent or reversed at the second firm, where the program is less robust and less tightly integrated into the corporate culture. EHFs do not improve perceived financial security. Findings have implications for studying unionization and union avoidance as well as the ``moral economy'' between low-wage workers and employers in the US.

It is now widely accepted that corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives can serve important corporate governance functions, especially around recruiting, motivating, and retaining workers [@ruppEmployeeReactionsCorporate2006; @turbanCorporateSocialPerformance1997; @bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021; @bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015; @greeningCorporateSocialPerformance2000; @portocarreroEffectsShortTermCorporate2024; @toninCorporatePhilanthropyProductivity2015]. But most empirical research examines external CSR--charitable donations, volunteerism, environmental commitments directed outside the firm. Less is known about how firms use CSR-like programs directed at their own employees. 

This paper documents and analyzes one such widespread but unstudied organizational practice: Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs). EHFs are employer-administered programs that provide emergency cash grants to workers facing unexpected crises--house fires, crime victimization, natural disasters, etc. What distinguishes EHFs from standard employee benefits is their structure: EHFs are funded substantially through donations from workers themselves, creating a hybrid of corporate welfare and worker mutual aid. Many large US employers now operate EHFs. We have documented over 320 firms with active programs, including nine of the ten largest US retailers. Despite their prevalence, EHFs remain almost entirely absent from management research.

EHFs sit at the intersection of three important organizational phenomena. First, they represent a contemporary form of welfare capitalism---employer-provided benefits designed to foster loyalty and attachment [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976; @jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998]. Second, they incorporate elements of mutual aid in which workers pool resources to assist one another, a practice historically associated with labor unions and fraternal organizations [@beitoMutualAidWelfare2000; @glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001; @dreyfusLabourMovementMutual1993; @webbHistoryTradeUnionism1920]. Third, they emerge in a US labor market characterized by low and declining unionization, rising employment precarity, and weakened public safety nets [@hackerGreatRiskShift2019; @naiduThereAnyFuture2022; @thelenAmericanPrecariatCapitalism2019]. This combination raises fundamental questions: How do workers perceive and engage with these programs? Do EHFs function as the genuine support mechanisms they claim to be? And what are their effects on workplace attachment and labor relations?

Drawing on three original, pre-registered yet exploratory studies, this paper provides the first systematic evidence on EHFs and their consequences.^[The study was pre-registered under osf.io/fhq93.  In appendix \@ref(app-PAP), I document where the execution, analysis, or reporting deviates from the pre-analysis plans.] Study 1 surveys US retail workers nationally to establish baseline awareness and attitudes. Despite EHFs prevalence among major retailers, only 23% of workers report their employer offers emergency cash assistance. Yet when EHF programs are described, workers appear to value them, rating them as attractive as improved health insurance when considering job offers. Workers also prefer EHF designs that give them voice in program governance.^[In background interviews with five EHF program administrators at large firms (not including Home Depot or Walmart), all emphasized that EHFs were important to their corporate culture and values. This framing informed our research design and expectations but suggests a disconnect between executive intent and worker awareness documented in Study 1.]

Studies 2 and 3 examine workers at two large retailers with established but programmatically distinct EHFs: Home Depot and Walmart. Home Depot's Homer Fund is generous (grants up to \$10,000), heavily promoted through social media and donation drives, and integrated into a corporate culture emphasizing teamwork and expertise around home improvement. Walmart's program, the Associates in Critical Need Trust Together Fund (ACNT), offers smaller grants (\$1,500 maximum), receives minimal promotion, and operates in a firm known for cost control rather than employee investment. Using survey experiments with independently recruited samples at each firm, I randomly expose workers to realistic information about their employer's EHF and measure effects on subjective financial security, job attachment, and support for unionization.

The findings reveal a striking paradox. EHF messaging produces no effect on subjective financial security in either sample even though the programs purport to address exactly this problem.  Nevertheless, exposure to EHF information at the Home Depot significantly increases job attachment and reduces support for unionization, particularly among workers previously unaware of the program. At Walmart, the same treatment produces opposite effects: reduced opposition to unions and increased perceptions that coworkers would support collective action, with no detectable effect on job attachment. These divergent effects correspond to differences in program generosity, promotion, and alignment with broader corporate culture.  With only two firms, we cannot definitively identify the mechanisms that produce and modify these EHF effects. But findings suggest that the effects of worker-oriented CSR like EHFs depend on both the nature of the program itself as well as its alignment with the other employment practices, norms, and messages that form a corporate culture. 

This research makes four contributions. First, it documents a widespread organizational practice that has escaped scholarly attention despite operating at scale across multiple industries. The descriptive findings about awareness, engagement patterns, and worker preferences establish important stylized facts about how contemporary firms blend private welfare with symbolic appeals to solidarity.

Second, the experimental findings uncover a consequential paradox: EHFs can foster affective attachment without necessarily improving subjective perceptions of financial security. This challenges assumptions that loyalty-building programs must deliver tangible benefits. Workers may respond to symbolic welfare--the perception of care and mutual support--regardless of whether programs actually enhance improve their economic situation. This has implications for understanding how organizational practices shape attachment.

Third, although there is work on how unionization affects CSR activities [@ertugrulLaborUnionsCorporate2021; @heitzPowerPeopleLabor2024], this study is, to my knowledge, the first to link worker-oriented CSR to worker interest in unionization. This broadens discussion about unions and union avoidance beyond traditional anti-union tactics to include CSR.  

Fourth, the findings complicate narratives about corporate social responsibility and worker welfare. EHFs are neither straightforwardly benevolent nor purely manipulative. They address real needs (workers claim to value them), but their governance effects depend on implementation and context. At their best, they may provide genuine emergency support while strengthening workplace community. At their worst, they may substitute symbolic gestures for meaningful security while discouraging collective action or they may backfire. The divergent effects at Home Depot and Walmart suggest these programs can operate as tools of labor relations management, but in ways that are context-dependent.

These findings matter for several audiences. For scholars of CSR and human resources, EHFs reveal how firms use welfare-adjacent programs as governance mechanisms, extending our understanding to new areas of employer-employee relations. For labor relations researchers, EHFs may be part of union avoidance operating through cultural signaling rather than threats. For researchers studying the privatization of welfare, EHFs illustrate how corporations fill gaps left by weakened public safety nets, raising normative questions about whose interests these arrangements ultimately serve.

The next section describes EHFs in practice, documenting their growth and variation.  Section \@ref(sec-lit-review) weaves together findings from the literatures on mutual aid, welfare capitalism, and CSR to motivate the core research questions.  Sections \@ref(sec-study-1) and \@ref(sec-study-2-3) present the three studies and results.  Section \@ref(sec-conclusion) discusses implications and limitations.  Details about the pre-analysis plan, surveys, measurement, and supplementary analysis are collected in the appendices.   

# EHFs in practice {#sec-ehf-bkgrnd}

The Home Depot and Walmart are two of the largest retailers in the world, with approximately 420,000 and 1.6 million 2024 US employees, respectively. These firms compete to some degree in both product and labor markets and both have experienced union activism. Their job benefits, programs, and procedures have an impact on the retail industry as a whole as well as the communities surrounding their establishments [@wiltshireWalmartSupercentersMonopsony2023; @derenoncourtVoluntaryMinimumWages2025; @wartzmanStillBrokeWalmarts2022].

Both firms operate in a contemporary US labor market where unionization rates remain historically low, public welfare and social insurance systems are under strain, and precarious employment arrangements are increasingly widespread [@abrahamMeasuringGigEconomy2021; @hackerGreatRiskShift2019; @naiduThereAnyFuture2022; @thelenAmericanPrecariatCapitalism2019; @weilFissuredWorkplace2014]. Workers in the lower half of the earnings and education distributions face stagnating wages and rising economic insecurity.  Economic precarity induces a "cognitive tax" on workers, negatively affecting numerous aspects of their lives, including job performance [@meurisPriceFinancialPrecarity2018; @meurisHighCostLow2015; @leanaOrganizationalBehaviorWorking2012; @mullainathanScarcity2013].

Against this backdrop, The Home Depot has maintained the Homer Fund since 1999 while Walmart started the ACNT in 2001.  Both programs are set up as non-profit charities (501c(3)) offering cash grants for employees facing emergency expenses.  The Homer Fund makes grants of up to \$10,000 while the Walmart fund makes grants of up to \$1,500.  Beyond simple generosity, the programs differ in multiple ways, including application procedures and the frequency with which a worker can receive a grant.   Both funds solicit (tax deductible) donations from both corporate and front-line employees.  Grants to workers are tax-exempt under US law.

Both ACNT and the Homer Fund are examples of Employee Hardship Funds (EHFs).  Outside of a small practitioner literature, there is very little accessible information about these programs [@associationofdisasterrelieffundsandemployeehardshipfundsEnvironmentalScanDisaster2013; @employeerelieffundeducationgroupEnvironmentalScanDisaster2019;@aspeninstituteIlluminatingHiddenSafety2019; @rodriguezEmployeeHardshipFunds2020;@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020].^[@amorimScheduleUnpredictabilityHighCost2022; @reichWorkingRespectCommunity2018 are the only two peer-reviewed pieces mentioning EHFs of which I am aware.] The practitioner reports rely on testimonials and interviews with EHF grant recipients or aggregated data on disbursement amounts.  We lack basic descriptive information such as employee awareness and engagement rates.  There is no systematic information about how these programs operate at scale, including who applies for grants, rates of approval, and grant amounts. 

Lacking a central database of EHFs, we have positively documented over 320 companies across multiple industries and sectors operating EHFs as of January 2025. Nine of the ten top US retailers by revenue have maintained an EHF. There is sufficient corporate interest in EHFs that a cottage industry in EHF management has developed.  Many employers now outsource the administration of their EHFs to third-party nonprofit partners, the largest of which appears to be the Employee Assistance Foundation (EAF).  EAF claims over 400 corporate clients and distributed over \$86 million in grants in 2020 according to IRS filings.^[Additional information about EHF regulation and third-party providers, including revenue and grant growth, is collected in appendix \@ref(app-3rd).] 

EHFs appear to be expanding along both the extensive and intensive margins in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Levi Strauss & Co. reported a three-fold increase in applications to their EHF in 2020 [@rodriguezEveryCompanyShould2020], with another spike in applications once coronavirus emergency aid programs expired in the US.  The Home Depot suspended fundraising from employees and expedited grant processing during the pandemic emergency. EAF reported a more than tenfold increase in grant applications relative to historical averages in the first two quarters of 2020 as well as 140 new client EHFs [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].   In May 2020 Amazon.com launched its EHF---using \$25 million in corporate money---in the face of extensive criticism of its workplace safety practices during the coronavirus outbreak as well as ongoing attempts to unionize its warehouse and fulfillment centers.  Amazon shuttered its EHF in August 2022.  

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-HfACNTcomps) zooms in on the Home Depot's Homer Fund and Walmart's ACNT using data from IRS 990 forms.  In the left panel I report net assets for each firm's nonprofit foundations.^[For tax purposes, both Homer Fund and ACNT EHFs are part of the larger Home Depot and Walmart corporate foundations, respectively.]  Both corporate charities show strong growth from 2010, but Homer Fund is operating at more than double the ACNT's size.  The right panel looks at grants to domestic individuals, my preferred indicator of EHF activity.^[The larger foundations typically focus on disbursing grants to other nonprofit and community organizations, as opposed to individuals.  The Homer Fund website reports disbursing \$17 million in 2023 EHF grants whereas the Home Depot foundation 2023 IRS form 990 reports \$19.1 million in grants to individuals.]  Homer Fund is making \$15-25 million in annual grants between 2008 and 2022 whereas ACNT typically disburses less than \$10 million, notwithstanding Walmart's much larger corporate presence.  Homer Fund reports making a total of over \$267 million in grants to more than 183,000 individuals over its existence. ACNT claims to have disbursed over \$142 million over its existence to over 145,000 workers.

The examples above illustrate how EHFs vary across firms in virtually all programmatic aspects including longevity, eligibility requirements, application procedures, grant generosity and frequency, funding structure, and even whether they are managed in-house or out-sourced to third parties. Although all EHFs have a mutual aid component, communication around the programs varies in tone and intensity.  Some firms, such as the Home Depot, aggressively promote their EHF programs, including through dedicated social media and YouTube channels as well as regular donation drives.  Others, such as Walmart, appear to put substantially less effort into promoting their program. Across firms, EHF messaging varies, sometimes emphasizing charitable motivations, sometimes emphasizing solidarity with co-workers, and sometimes framing the EHF as more of a job amenity.  Several major retailers, including the Home Depot, highlight their EHFs in their annual Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023], suggesting that these firms view EHFs as part of their broader CSR strategy.

Two critical features distinguish EHFs from other job amenities or employer-based insurance benefits, making EHFs particularly interesting from a CSR and corporate governance perspective.  The first is their charitable/mutual aid nature.  In EHFs, employers ask both corporate and front line workers to donate their own money into a fund, with the goal of assisting fellow employees in need. The employer sponsors the outreach and administrative apparatus for soliciting and directing charitable contributions towards their own workforce.    

Second, EHFs are potentially accessible to hourly, part-time, and contract workers, as opposed to other benefits and labor protections that only accrue to directly-employed workers, especially those working full-time. EHFs are one tool firms can use to direct some benefits to their workers---perhaps improving morale and blunting public criticism---while retaining the flexibility that makes non-standard employment contracting attractive.  There are examples consistent with this interpretation. Amazon.com restricted its EHF to "Amazon Flex Delivery Partners, Delivery Service Partner Delivery Associates, Temporary Associates employed by eligible staffing agencies, and drivers of eligible line haul partners," i.e., non-standard, temporary contract labor.  EAF updated its EHF program guidelines, recommending that employers "include contractors, furloughed employees, and franchise employees" in their EHF schemes [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022].

# Understanding EHFs: Welfare capitalism, mutual aid, and contemporary labor relations {#sec-lit-review}

Employee Hardship Funds blend elements from distinct organizational and social traditions. Understanding their potential effects requires situating them within three intersecting literatures: employer-sponsored welfare capitalism, worker mutual aid, and corporate social responsibility as a governance mechanism.

## Welfare capitalism and employer-provided benefits

EHFs can be viewed as a contemporary manifestation of welfare capitalism, whereby employers provide significant amenities and services to workers beyond wages in order to attract and retain labor and forestall unionization. Welfare capitalism emerged in the early 20th century as firms in manufacturing and mining offered housing, healthcare, recreation, and emergency assistance to retain workers and forestall unionization [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976;@jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998]. Some large industrial firms created employer-sponsored "company unions" that substituted for independent unions' social and mutual aid functions but lacked any independent voice around wages, staffing, and benefits [@brandesAmericanWelfareCapitalism1976].

The economics of welfare capitalism are straightforward: employers offer amenities to prevent unionization, reduce turnover, and maintain labor supply [@farberNonunionWageRates2005; @rosenTradeUnionPower1969]. When benefits are tied to continued employment at a specific firm, they increase switching costs and worker attachment [@baronEmploymentEconomicSocial2012; @kampkotterEmployeeIdentificationWages2021]. Modern research confirms these dynamics persist: firms use wages and benefits strategically to preempt organizing, undermine unionization drives, and compete for workers  [@jacobyModernManorsWelfare1998; @kochanWorkersOrganizingEfforts2022;  @taschereau-dumouchelUnionThreat2020; @ahlquistLaborUnionsPolitical2017].

EHFs fit this tradition. They are employer-sponsored, employer-administered programs that workers cannot take with them if they leave. Unlike historical welfare capitalism's significant capital investments (company towns, hospitals), EHFs require minimal employer commitment.  Most funding comes from workers themselves, contributions are tax-deductible, and programs can be scaled up or down at will. This makes EHFs an attractive tool as they appear to address worker needs while imposing limited and controllable costs on employers.

## Mutual aid and worker solidarity

In EHFs, workers donate money that is then distributed to fellow workers in crisis. This structure evokes the long tradition of worker mutual aid in which workers pool resources to assist one another during hardship [@beitoMutualAidWelfare2000; @glennUnderstandingMutualBenefit2001; @dreyfusLabourMovementMutual1993].

Historically, workers themselves created and controlled mutual aid organizations.  These organizations coalesced around shared occupation, region, or ethnicity and created dense social networks and organizational capacity [@ismayTrustStrangersFriendly2018]. Many evolved into labor unions [@webbHistoryTradeUnionism1920; @bacharachMutualAidUnion2018; @jarleyUnionsSocialCapital2005] or served as organizing structures when unions were suppressed [@morrisCriminalConspiracyEarly1937; @blochVoluntaryAssociationsCorporate2017]. Unions continue to maintain emergency aid programs and insurance schemes to recruit, retain, and support members [@olsonLogicCollectiveAction1965; @hertel-fernandezWhyPublicSector2021]. 

EHFs appropriate the rhetoric and structure of mutual aid and may connect with the same solidaristic motivations associated with unions [@akerlofTheorySocialCustom1980; @naylorEconomicTheoryOpen1993].  But EHF control and governance differ fundamentally from traditional mutual aid. Workers do not organize or direct EHFs. In most programs, workers need not donate to receive benefits (unlike true mutualist arrangements). EHFs are employer-specific, lack the cross-firm networks that characterized fraternal organizations, and do not build organizational capacity among workers. In some cases, workers must petition their direct supervisors to support EHF grant applications, embedding aid-seeking in hierarchical employment relationships rather than horizontal networks.

This distinction matters. If EHFs foster a sense of mutual support and solidarity among workers, they might strengthen collective identity in ways that build a "community of fate" and support unionization [@ahlquistInterestOthersOrganizations2013]. Workers might interpret EHFs as evidence that collective pooling of resources improves their situation, making union appeals more attractive. Alternatively, if workers attribute the existence and administration of EHFs to employer benevolence rather than worker collective action or if EHFs substitute for union benefits, EHFs might reduce perceived need for unions. The direction of effect likely depends on how EHFs are framed and implemented.

## CSR and job attachment

A large literature examines how CSR shapes worker attitudes and behavior, both on the job and in interactions with external stakeholders. Research distinguishes between external CSR (charitable donations, environmental commitments, community voluntarism) and internal CSR that includes particular workplace conditions, HR practices, and employee training and well-being programs  [@brammerContributionCorporateSocial2007; @farooqMultiplePathwaysWhich2017; @hawnMindGapInterplay2016; @elakremiHowEmployeesPerceive2018].
  
Studies of external CSR show that workers value employer pro-social activities. CSR can attract value-aligned workers [@brekkeAttractingResponsibleEmployees2008; @greeningCorporateSocialPerformance2000; @turbanCorporateSocialPerformance1997] and reduce the wage required to attract high performers [@burbanoSocialResponsibilityMessages2016; @wilmersValuesInequalityProsocial2022a].  CSR can increase worker identification with the firm [@ruppEmployeeReactionsCorporate2006; @brammerContributionCorporateSocial2007], strengthen attachment to coworkers [@bodeCorporateSocialInitiatives2015], and reduce turnover [@portocarreroEffectsShortTermCorporate2024]. Experiments in labs and online labor markets find that information about employer charitable activities increases worker productivity [@toninCorporatePhilanthropyProductivity2015], elicits unpaid effort [@burbanoGettingGigWorkers2021; @cassarJobMissionSubstitute2019], and reduces willingness to engage in misconduct [@burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022].

However, CSR effects are highly contingent on worker beliefs about managerial motivations and consistency with other organizational practices [@grantGivingTimeTime2012; @cassarIntentionsDoingGood2021; @ashrafSocialIncentivesOrganizations2018]. When CSR appears instrumental or inconsistent with internal employment practices, effects weaken or reverse [@burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022; @amengualTrueMotivesProsocial2021; @listWhenCorporateSocial2021]. Workers are sensitive to authenticity: CSR paired with surveillance, poor working conditions, or other signals of distrust can backfire [@gatignon-turnauMisUsingEmployeeVolunteering2015; @zhaoInfluenceCorporateSocial2022].

EHFs occupy ambiguous territory in this literature. They are formally charitable programs (501(c)(3) nonprofits) but directed internally at workers. They combine elements of employee amenities and mutual aid (internal) with charitable donations (pro-social). Existing theory on social identity suggests that programs emphasizing in-group support should produce stronger attachment effects than external charity [@linModelingCorporateCitizenship2010] with mixed empirical support [@farooqMultiplePathwaysWhich2017]. But whether workers interpret EHFs as genuine care or instrumental manipulation likely depends on program design and broader workplace context.

## Research questions and hypotheses
These literatures suggest several lines of inquiry around EHFs, but also areas of uncertainty where empirical evidence is needed to adjudicate between competing possibilities.  For ease of exposition and to connect with the statistical analysis, I frame these research questions as testable hypotheses.

- **H1 (Financial Security):** EHFs are designed and promoted as programs to improve worker financial resilience during emergencies. If they function as intended, informing workers about these programs should improve workers' sense of financial security.

Exposure to EHF messaging improves workers' subjective financial security.

- **H2 (Awareness):** If EHFs function as tools for attracting and retaining value-aligned workers (as CSR theory suggests), then employers should promote them widely and workers should be aware of both their own employer's EHF and those at competing firms.

Workers should be broadly aware of EHF programs at their employer and at other major employers in their industry.

- **H3 (Attachment):** Both welfare capitalism and CSR literatures predict that benefits and CSR programs increase worker attachment. EHFs combine both elements--they are employer-run benefits with charitable framing emphasizing care and mutual support. The mutual aid component might further strengthen attachment by fostering connections among coworkers.

Exposure to EHF messages increases workers' job attachment.

- **H4 (Unionization):** Here theory is ambiguous. Welfare capitalism suggests EHFs should reduce union support by providing benefits that unions might otherwise secure. But the mutual aid structure might have opposite effects by demonstrating the value of collective pooling and mutual support, potentially increasing receptivity to unions. The direction likely depends on how programs are framed and whether workers attribute benefits to employer generosity or collective worker action.

Exposure to EHF messaging will affect support for unionization, though the direction is theoretically ambiguous.

- **H5 (Contingency):** The CSR literature clearly establishes that effects depend on perceived authenticity and consistency with other organizational practices [@grantGivingTimeTime2012; @cassarIntentionsDoingGood2021; @grahamCorporateCultureEvidence2022]. We should expect similar contingency with EHFs. Programs that are more generous, more heavily promoted, and more consistent with the broader corporate culture emphasizing teamwork and mutual obligation should produce stronger effects than programs that are minimal or inconsistent with workers' other experiences.

The effects of EHF messaging on attachment and unionization will be stronger where programs are more generous and more deeply embedded in organizational culture.

Of course, with data from only two firms, we can only observe whether effects differ between firms with different EHF characteristics.  We cannot isolate with high confidence which programmatic features drive differences. This limitation points to an important area for future research with larger samples or different research designs.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-hypotheses) for ease of reference. Note that H1-H3 represent predictions from existing theory applied to the EHF context. H4 acknowledges theoretical ambiguity. H5 is less a hypothesis than a boundary condition suggested by prior CSR research. The empirical contribution lies not in testing novel theory, but in establishing basic facts about a widespread but unstudied practice and documenting effects that existing theory does not clearly predict.

Before examining EHF effects experimentally, we must establish basic facts. Do workers know about EHF programs? How do they perceive them? What features do they value? Study 1 provides the first systematic evidence on worker awareness, engagement, and preferences regarding EHFs.

We focus on retail workers for several reasons. Retail employed over 16 million Americans in 2024, making it one of the largest employment sectors. The industry is characterized by low wages, limited benefits, high turnover, and recent high-profile unionization campaigns. Nine of the ten largest US retailers maintain EHFs, yet no research has examined worker awareness or attitudes toward these programs. If EHFs function as governance tools or worker recruitment mechanisms (as CSR theory suggests), retail workers should be aware of them.

## Sample and methods

We fielded an online survey targeting US adults employed in retail using the CloudResearch incentivized panel. The survey was in the field from February 12-22, 2025. We restricted the sample to respondents with US IP addresses who confirmed current retail employment and passed two attention check questions.^[Respondents with duplicate IP addresses reporting identical demographic values were also excluded.] The final sample comprised `r nrow(genpop)` valid responses.  

To address potential selection bias in online panels, we constructed post-stratification weights using 2024 American Community Survey data on US retail workers. Weights adjust for gender, race, and education to match the employed retail workforce nationally. All descriptive statistics reported below use weighted calculations. Sample demographic descriptions appear in Appendix \@ref(app-genpop-survsum), but we note that the unweighted sample was diverse (37% non-white, 51% male) and largely comprised of hourly workers (83%).

## Measuring EHF awareness

We approach the the measure of EHF awareness cautiously, as we want to avoid research demand or social desirability effects in all three studies.  Moreover, we are also interested in how well workers understand EHFs.  With this in mind, our preferred measure EHF awareness uses a list-based approach.  We asked respondents which of a list of benefits and amenities they had at their current retail job.  The EHF response on this list is "Emergency cash assistance to help in unexpected hard times."  In Study 1, we also subsequently explained EHFs asked respondents directly whether they had heard of EHFs prior to the survey and whether their current employer offered an such a program.  Note that, in Study 1, we are unable to confirm the accuracy of respondents' reports about their employers' EHFs, so these quantities represent beliefs only.  

## Results: limited awareness despite expressed interest

**Finding 1: Low awareness of EHF programs**
```{r genpop-awareness-calcs, echo=FALSE}
genpop_aware_tab<- genpop_w |> summarise(
          got.ehf.prop = survey_mean(emerg_assist_benefits=="Yes", 
                                         na.rm=TRUE),
          aware.prior.prop = survey_mean(ehf_prior_know=="Yes", na.rm=T),
          claim.ehf.prop = survey_mean(ehf_own_comp == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE)
          #know.prop = survey_mean(HF_know=="Yes", na.rm=T),  # too many NAs
          #applied.prop = survey_mean(HF_applied=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #received.prop = survey_mean(HF_received=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #donated.prop = survey_mean(HF_donate=="Yes", na.rm=T),
         #eligible.prop = survey_mean(Q4.2=="Yes", na.rm=T),
          )
```

We find that `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$got.ehf.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$got.ehf.prop_se)`%) report that their current employer offers emergency cash support whereas `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$claim.ehf.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$claim.ehf.prop_se)`%) claim to have an EHF when asked directly.  For context, `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$aware.prior.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*genpop_aware_tab$aware.prior.prop_se)`%) said that they had heard of EHF programs prior to taking the survey. In a separate, Fall 2022 survey of front line workers in five industries (including retail), @ahlquistWERNWorkersSurvey2023 found that only 13% of retail workers reported that their employer had an emergency cash grant program using the same question method [@ahlquistVoiceJobYounger2023; @ahlquistWERNWorkersSurvey2023].  

We also tested knowledge about EHFs at specific employers. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-beliefs) shows retail worker beliefs about whether six major retailers operate EHFs.^[The employers were Costco (no), Disney (yes), Home Depot (yes), Kohl's (yes), Starbucks (yes), Walmart (yes).] Regardless of whether respondents' own employer has an EHF, large majorities express ignorance about programs at major employers. Even for Walmart and Home Depot, two of the largest retail employers which have operated EHFs for over 20 years--fewer than 30\% of workers correctly identified these firms as having programs.

  )

Workers whose own employer has an EHF are somewhat more likely to correctly identify programs at other retailers, but knowledge remains limited. This contradicts H3 (awareness). If EHFs served as significant tools for attracting value-aligned workers, we would expect much higher awareness both of one's own employer's program and of programs at competing firms. The evidence suggests EHFs operate with low salience in retail labor markets.

**Finding 2: Strong interest in EHFs...once explained**

Despite limited awareness, workers respond enthusiastically when EHFs are explained. We provided all respondents with a brief description embedded in one of the direct questions:

> "Some companies offer their employees programs called "Employee Hardship Funds." Employee Hardship Funds provide emergency cash to a company's workers if they face unexpected financial hardships, such as a house or apartment fire. The emergency money from the Employee Hardship Fund is not a loan and does not have to be repaid. The money in the fund comes directly from donations from the company's own workers. Before taking this survey, had you ever heard of Employee Hardship Funds?"

We subsequently asked whether their current retail employer has an EHF and their level of support for such a program.

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-support) displays support for an EHF at one's current employer.  When asked, large majorities report "extreme" support for an EHF, with those who already have such a program showing even stronger support than those asked to consider a hypothetical program, with `r round(100*support_sum$prop[1])`% "extremely" supportive against `r round(100*support_sum$prop[4])`% (The $p-$value for the difference is `r round(tt$p.value,2)`).  

We asked about willingness to donate to an EHF, `r round(100*genpop_engage_sum$donte_new)`% would donate, if their employer created an EHF, with the modal response being "regular donations of less than \$20." This suggests that workers see value in pooling resources to help coworkers.  

```{r fig-genpop-support, fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", fig.cap="Worker support for creating (R) or maintaining (L) an EHF at current job."}
ehf_support_genpop
```

**Finding 3: EHFs valued as a job amenity**

To assess how workers value EHFs relative to other amenities, we presented a hypothetical job scenario and a series of potential job amenities:

> "Imagine another retailer was hiring, paying the same wage you are earning at [Employer].  The new job has a commute that is 10 minutes longer but has better benefits.  How seriously would you consider this offer, if the better benefits were [Benefit]?"

We then asked respondents to rate their interest in the hypothetical job (not at all seriously, somewhat seriously, very seriously).
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-prefs) shows results. "Emergency cash offered during hard times" ranks second only to paid time off in generating very serious interest in switching employers. Notably, EHFs are rated as more attractive than parental leave or union representation. At median hourly wages in our sample (\$16/hour), the additional 20-minute daily commute implies forgoing approximately `r paste("$",round(1/3*genpop_engage_sum$wage_med,2), sep="")` in earnings per round trip to work.^[I focused on difference in commute time rather than a difference in hourly wage rates because shift availability and scheduling practices are highly variable within and across retailers [@harknettImprovingHealthEconomic2021;@schneiderHardTimesRoutine2021].] That workers would seriously consider this trade off for an EHF suggests they perceive substantial value in these programs, even though many are unaware whether their current employer already offers one.

```{r fig-genpop-prefs, fig.show="hold", out.width="80%", fig.cap="Degree of interest in a new job with longer commute but better amenities."}
amenity_plot_w_gp
```

**Finding 4: workers want a voice in the EHF**

Finally, I asked respondents who did not report having an EHF how much control workers _should_ have if their employer launched such a program.  Figure \@ref(fig:fig-genpop-control) indicates that large majorities preferred an EHF arrangement in which workers have a voice in running the fund.  The modal response is a shared governance model with input from both the employer and workers; only `r round(100*control_sum$prop[1])`% want complete employer control.

This preference aligns with broader evidence of strong latent worker demand for voice over workplace decisions [@mazumderWhatAmericansWant2024; @kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019a]. It also suggests tension between how workers would prefer EHFs to operate (participatory mutual aid) and how they actually function (employer-controlled programs). This gap may be consequential: if workers perceive EHFs as top-down corporate programs rather than worker-driven mutual aid, effects on solidarity and attachment may differ from what pure mutual aid would produce.

## Discussion

Study 1 establishes previously unknown facts about EHFs in the retail sector. First, fewer than one in four retail workers claims their employer offers emergency cash assistance. This persists despite major retailers operating these programs for years. Second, when explained, workers value EHFs, rating them as attractive as improved health insurance when considering job offers, reflecting the economic precarity experienced by many retail workers today. Third, workers would prefer programs that give them some voice in governance over purely employer-controlled programs.

These findings are difficult to reconcile with expectations derived from standard CSR theory in which EHFs function as recruitment tools or signals to attract value-aligned workers. If that mechanism were operating, awareness should be far higher. Instead, the evidence suggests EHFs may shaping attitudes among workers who do become aware, but not serving as prominent features in labor market competition.

The disconnect between low awareness and high stated value also raises questions. Why aren't workers more aware of a benefit they strongly value? Three possibilities emerge. First, most employers may not actually promote EHFs as heavily to front line workers as corporate communications and interviews suggest, consistent with Walmart's limited promotional effort. Second, workers may have been exposed but the information doesn't stick because it is bundled with many other messages (e.g., during employee on-boarding) or workers  don't anticipate needing emergency funds (optimism bias). Third, workers may be aware of a charitable program or even the program name (e.g., "Homer Fund"), but the do not connect promotional messaging with the concept "emergency cash assistance" used in our survey.

Studies 2 and 3 move from descriptive documentation to experimental analysis, examining whether exposure to realistic EHF information affects worker attitudes. We concentrate on two large retailers with established EHFs that differ substantially in generosity and promotion: Home Depot and Walmart.

# Studies 2 \& 3: experimental evidence from the Home Depot and Walmart {#sec-study-2-3}

Studies 2 and 3 examine how exposure to realistic EHF messages affects worker attitudes using survey experiments with employees at two large US retailers. Study 1 documented that retail workers are largely unaware of EHF programs but value them highly when explained. We now ask: when workers do learn about their employer's EHF, how does that information affect their sense of financial security, attachment to the workplace, and attitudes toward unionization?

We focus on Home Depot and Walmart because both firms operate well-established, in-house EHFs with over 20 years of continuous operation, making them mature programs that workers have had ample opportunity to encounter. They are extremely large employers, which makes recruiting a survey sample feasible.   By concentrating on specific firms I can tailor questions about EHF awareness and engagement while designing context-specific survey experiments. Critically, these firms' EHFs differ substantially in generosity, promotion, and cultural integration, allowing us to explore boundary conditions and assess whether findings in one context replicate in another program (H5). Two studies cannot definitively identify which specific features, but effect variation provides initial evidence on contingency.

## Case selection \& program characteristics

The Home Depot operates the the Homer Fund, established in 1999.  The program is among the most generous we have uncovered, offering grants up to \$10,000 per qualifying event with eligibility from the first day of employment. Workers can apply multiple times for different events. In fiscal year 2022 (the year of our survey), the Homer Fund distributed $21.2 million to over 12,000 workers [@thehomedepotEnvironmentalSocialGovernance2023].

Importantly, Home Depot actively promotes the Homer Fund through regular donation drives, a dedicated YouTube channel with professional testimonial videos, and integration into corporate social responsibility messaging. Different store locations compete in fundraising campaigns. The Homer Fund claims that a "majority of contributions" come from front line associates, emphasizing the mutual aid component.^[ [https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0](https://corporate.homedepot.com/page/homer-fund-0) ]  The Home Depot is widely viewed as among the better retail employers [@charanHomeDepotsBlueprint2006].  @sullMeasuringCultureLeading2019 develop measures  of corporate culture, ranking the Home Depot at the 77th percentile for "collaboration" and 48th percentile for "respect" based on employee reviews, suggesting relatively high trust and teamwork compared to other retailers.

Walmart operates the Associates in Critical Need Trust (ACNT), established in 2001 and renamed the ACNT Together Fund in 2021. The program is substantially less generous: maximum grants of \$1,500 in a rolling 5-year period, regardless of how many qualifying events occur. Eligibility requires 90 days of tenure, meaning approximately 13\% of new hires leave before becoming eligible (based on general retail turnover rates).^[Walmart employee turnover is estimated at about the retail industry annual average of 44% [@cascioHighCostLow2006].  Assuming an exponential distribution for separations, this works out to a monthly hazard rate of 4.8%, implying that $1-\exp(−0.048*3) \approx 13.5$% exit within 3 months.] In recent years, ACNT has distributed under \$10 million annually despite Walmart employing nearly four times as many US workers as Home Depot.

Based on publicly visible evidence, Walmart provides minimal promotion of the ACNT. Although the Together Fund is accessible through the Walmart employee intranet, there is very limited social media presence, no dedicated promotional videos, and no evidence of donation drives comparable to Home Depot's.^[Interestingly, Walmart matches employee donations to the Walmart political action committee 2:1 with corporate donations to the ACNT. In 2015, the Federal Election Commission rejected a challenge to this practice.  In our sample, fewer than 1% of respondents reported making a contribution to the Walmart PAC.] @sullMeasuringCultureLeading2019 rank Walmart's corporate culture ranks at the 15th percentile for "respect" and 37th percentile for "collaboration. The firm is known more for aggressive cost control than employee investment [@cascioDecencyMeansMore2006; @wartzmanStillBrokeWalmarts2022; @reichWorkingRespectCommunity2018], notwithstanding a recent push to raise wages though a "voluntary minimum wage" [@derenoncourtVoluntaryMinimumWages2025].

Table \@ref(tab:tab-ehf-comparison) summarizes key differences between the firms:

```{r tab-ehf-comparison, echo=FALSE}

  Feature = c("Established", "Maximum grant", "Eligibility",

              "Low",
              "Cost control, efficiency",
              "37 %ile (collaboration), 15 %ile (respect)",
              "In-house")
)

kable(ehf_comparison,
      col.names = c("Feature", "Home Depot (Homer Fund)", "Walmart (ACNT)"),
      caption = "EHF Program Characteristics Comparison",
      booktabs = TRUE,
      longtable = TRUE) %>%

  column_spec(1, width = "3cm") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "5.5cm") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "5.5cm")
```

Under the logic that produced H5,  EHF information should produce stronger effects at Home Depot, where the program is more generous and more deeply embedded in organizational culture. Walmart's minimal program may fail to produce attachment effects or could even backfire if workers perceive it as insufficient or insincere.

## Respondent recruitment and sample description 

We recruited participants independently for each firm using targeted advertising on Meta platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads). This approach has demonstrated validity for sampling retail workers [@schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019; @growFacebooksAdvertisingData2022] . We targeted ads to users aged 18 and older residing in the United States whom Meta identified as employees of Home Depot or Walmart based on user-provided employment information.

Respondents who clicked through completed screening questions confirming current employment.  We required respondents to pass attention checks and we eliminated respondents who shared IP addresses.  We then randomly and independently assigned respondents to experimental conditions. Those completing the survey were offered entry into a raffle for an iPad Mini or Visa gift card. This recruitment strategy likely produces some selection bias relative to a hypothetical random sample, but the directionality of this basis is ex ante unclear and this recruitment strategy has been shown to perform well in similar contexts [@schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019; @zhangQuotaSamplingUsing2020; @neundorfHowImproveRepresentativeness2023]. Importantly, the social media recruitment strategy is the only cost-effective way to generate large matched worker-employer survey samples independent of employer cooperation.

Study 2 (Home Depot) was fielded from September 7 to October 15, 2021, producing 515 valid responses. Study 3 (Walmart) was fielded from October 23 to December 4, 2024, producing `r nrow(wmt.hq)` valid responses. The timing difference is a limitation we return to in discussion. Following @schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019, we construct raking weights using Meta-reported age and gender distributions for users claiming employment at each firm. Weighted sample statistics appear comparable to retail workforce demographics. We use weights for descriptive reporting but not for experimental analysis.  Summary statistics and correlation tables for key variables appear in Appendices \@ref(app:app-survsum-uw) and \@ref(app-wmt-survsum) for Studies 2 and 3, respectively.  Both samples are composed almost entirely of workers paid hourly,  both have an average age of 47, and both samples skew white (79% at Home Depot and 81% at Walmart). The Walmart sample skews heavily female (78%) while the Home Depot sample is 56% male.

          )

```

## EHF awareness and engagement

Before describing the experimental design, we document pre-existing awareness and engagement with EHFs in each sample. This provides two critical pieces of information: baseline awareness rates for employers with known EHF programs, and identification of which respondents were already exposed to EHF information before our experiment (the "pre-exposed").  We measured awareness using the same list-based approach as Study 1.  This pre-treatment measure of EHF awareness is available for all survey respondents without contaminating the survey experiment. In Appendix \@ref(app-HFaware), I discuss two other indicators of awareness and compare them with the preferred "list" measure. 
      
```{r awareness-calcs, echo=FALSE}
aware_tab<-summarise(THD_comp, 
          aware.prop.l = survey_mean(EHF_aware_list),

aware_donate_xt <- svytable(~EHF_aware_list + HF_donate, THD_comp, round=T)
```

**Home Depot**

In the Home Depot sample, `r 100*round(aware_tab$aware.prop.l,2)`% (se = `r 100*round(aware_tab$aware.prop.l_se,2)`%) identified emergency cash grants as a job amenity.  This is substantially higher than the 14% of general retail workers who correctly identified the Home Depot as having an EHF. This suggests Home Depot's active promotion has achieved greater worker awareness than typical in retail, although two in five Home Depot workers remain unaware in spite of significant promotion.  

As indicators of engagement, we asked whether respondents had donated to, applied to, received money from, and know personally someone who has received money from the Homer Fund.^[In Study 2, the applied and "know someone" questions were asked only of treatment group respondents (post-treatment) while the EHF donation and grant receipt questions were asked of all respondents (post treatment).  This differs somewhat from Study 3 (see subsequent footnote).  Nevertheless rates of grant donation and receipt were nearly identical for treated and control respondents, so we include all available observations in the Table \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model).]  Fifty-four percent report personally knowing a coworker who received a grant, indicating the grants reach a meaningful portion of the workforce. A remarkable `r round(100*aware_tab$donated.prop,1)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab$donated.prop_se,1)`%) reported having donated, although 30% of those claiming donation failed to identify emergency cash grants as an amenity. This suggests some respondents may fail to connect the charitable and mutual aid functions of the EHF program, indicating broad-but-thin awareness.

Application and grant receipt estimates are impressive.  We find that, respectively, `r round(100*aware_tab$applied.prop)`% and  `r round(100*aware_tab$received.prop)`% applied for and received EHF grants.  Among workers who reported experiences in the last 12 months that should qualify for emergency aid (`r round(100*aware_tab$eligible.prop)`% of sample), `r round(100*takeup$takeup.prop)`% applied to the Homer Fund.

We find that `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$aware.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$aware.prop_se)`%) were aware of the ACNT, higher than the 20% of general retail workers identifying an EHF at Walmart but substantially lower than at the Home Depot. This 23-percentage-point awareness gap between the Home Depot and Walmart samples corresponds to differences in program promotion. Just `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$know.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$know.prop_se)`%) claim to know a grant recipient and only `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$donated.prop)`% (se = `r round(100*aware_tab_wmt$donated.prop_se)`%)  claim to have donated. Of those who both knew about the ACNT _and_ experienced a likely qualifying event, `r round(100*takeup_wmt$takeup.prop)`% applied for a grant, half the rate of the Home Depot.^[Study 3 differed from Study 2 in that we asked all Walmart respondents (not just control respondents) whether their employer has an EHF (post-treatment).  Those incorrectly answering "No" were not shown the EHF engagement questions, reflected in the $N$ in Table \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model-wmt).  Thus the subset of respondents reporting EHF engagement differs somewhat between Studies 2 and 3.  Nevertheless, restricting the Study 2 sample to only treated respondents produces nearly identical comparisons across studies.]  

### Predictors of awareness and engagement

Tables \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model) and \@ref(tab:tab-awareness-model-wmt) report coefficient estimates and standard errors from weighted logistic regressions examining the pre-registered predictors of EHF awareness and engagement at each firm. Job tenure is the most consistent and precisely estimated predictor across both firms and all outcomes. Longer-tenured workers are significantly more likely to be aware of EHFs, donate, apply, and receive grants. This makes sense—workers have more opportunities to encounter information about programs over time.

Gender differences are notable and consistent with past findings [@brammerContributionCorporateSocial2007]: men are significantly less aware and less engaged with EHFs at both firms. At Walmart, this gender gap persists even after controlling for tenure and full-time status. Other demographics (race, education, hourly status) show inconsistent relationships across firms and outcomes.

```{r tab-awareness-model, echo=FALSE}

```


```{r tab-awareness-model-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="ACNT awareness and engagement" }

```

Beyond their descriptive importance, these patterns matter for interpreting experimental results. It appears that workers become aware of EHFs over time, perhaps through repeated exposure and word-of-mouth. Thus workers entering our experiment already aware ("pre-exposed") differ systematically from the unaware, especially in job tenure. Our experiment examines whether a one-time information treatment can shift attitudes, which is different from studying how ongoing, gradual awareness shapes attachment over time or how the introduction of a new program might work.

## Experimental design

In both studies, we randomly assigned respondents to receive either information about their employer's EHF or to control conditions receiving no EHF information. The core design is similar across studies, with some refinements in Study 3 based on Study 2 results.

The experiment in Study 2 (Home Depot) included three conditions:

* Control ($N=164$): No information about Homer Fund
* _Text_ treatment ($N=197$): Brief, neutral textual description of Homer Fund
* _Video_ treatment ($N=154$): Actual Home Depot-produced promotional video

The text treatment stated: 

> "Your employer, The Home Depot, maintains a program called the Homer Fund. The Homer Fund combines donations from workers like you with money from the Home Depot corporation. The Homer Fund uses this money to offer cash grants of up to $10,000 to Home Depot employees in times of unexpected financial hardship like a natural disaster, illness, or death in the family."

Neutral textual descriptions do not reflect how employers actually communicate with their employees.  As a more realistic intervention, we ask respondents in the video treatment to watch a professionally-produced testimonial video featuring a Home Depot employee who received Homer Fund assistance during a serious illness. It emphasizes emotional themes of family crisis, coworker support, and comparing the Homer Fund to military camaraderie.  The video is publicly available on Home Depot's YouTube channel and corporate website; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (a) displays a still image.^[The video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-HBoySMe) and here: [https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story](https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/foundation-and-community/homer-fund-celebrates-20-years-giving-rays-story). The video is 2:41 in length.]

```{r fig-ray, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Screen stills of the video treatments", fig.subcap = c("Home Depot", "Walmart"), out.width="50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics( c(
  here('4_output', 'plots','RaysStory.jpeg' ),
  here('4_output', 'plots','Rays_story_wmt.png')
  )
)
```

The Study 3 (Walmart) experiment also included three conditions:

 * Pure control ($N=260$): No information
 * Placebo control ($N=254$): Video about Walmart's acquisition of Vizio
 * Video treatment ($N=466$): Adapted EHF video

Note that Study 3 concentrates on a video vignette treatment for the Walmart sample, omitting the text treatment based on results from the Study 2. Because Walmart does not produce promotional videos for the ACNT and for close comparability to the Home Depot experiment, we produced our own video message that mirrors the Homer Fund video's structure, script, and production style. We hired an actor matching Ray's demographics (white male, approximately age 50) and adapted the script to Walmart/ACNT context. The Walmart video is 41 seconds shorter (trimming only visual transitions, not spoken content). Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ray), panel (b) displays a still image from the beginning of the video.^[Videos can be seen here: [placebo video](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-placebo); [treatment (solidarity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHFStudy3-solidarity); [treatment (charity card)](https://tinyurl.com/EHF-Study3-charity).]   

Respondents were randomly divided between treatment and control.  Within the control condition, respondents were further randomized between the pure control and a placebo video arm designed to address concerns that findings might be a "video effect", as opposed the effect of an EHF message.  Respondents in the placebo condition watched a video in which the same hired actor reads a Walmart press release about the company's acquisition of Vizio. 

Manipulation checks (see Appendix \@ref(app-manip-wmt)) confirm that the video treatment did indeed increase respondent awareness of the ACNT, as expected whereas the placebo had no effect. Similarly, the ACNT video successfully increased respondents' behavioral willingness to donate to the EHF, as expected, whereas the placebo had no effect (see Appendix \@ref(app-donate-wmt)). We therefore combine the pure and placebo controls in analysis below.^[Within the Study 3 treatment arm, we also randomized between two variations of the video (different title card before pressing play, all other content identical): "charity" framing emphasizing charitable donations vs. "solidarity" framing emphasizing supporting fellow Walmart workers. This pre-registered sub-experiment tested whether solidarity vs. charity framing matters. We found no detectable differences for any outcome (Appendix \@ref(app-framing)), so we pool all treated respondents in the main text.]

Immediately after the experimental condition, all respondents answered questions measuring our three key outcomes: financial security, job attachment, and union support. 

## Outcome measurement

We outline measurement of key outcomes here, with extensive detail and justification appearing in Appendix \@ref(app-measurement).  All ordered categorical variables are re-scaled to the $[0,1]$ interval.

We measure _subjective financial security_ adapting the Federal Reserve's standard question from the Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making question [@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemEconomicWellBeingHouseholds2023]: "How confident are you that you could come up with \$400 if an unexpected need arose within the next month?" The responses on a 4-point scale range from "certain I could not" to "certain I could". This widely-used indicator of subjective financial resilience asks about the exact type of hardships that EHFs claim to address [@groverWhat400Emergency2021].

We use multiple indicators of _job attachment_:

* Loyalty to coworkers (4-point scale, "none at all" to "a lot")
* Loyalty to employer (same scale)
* Willingness to recommend employer (5-point scale, "definitely would not recommend" to "certainly would recommend")
* Quit intentions (Study 3 only; 5-point scale from "not at all likely" to "extremely likely", reverse-scaled)

For concision, we express these variables as a job attachment index.  We conducted exploratory factor analysis on these items in both samples. Results showed a single dominant factor explaining 64% (Study 2) and 54% (Study 3) of variance. Internal consistency reliability was acceptable (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = 0.84 at Home Depot and 0.81 at Walmart). Following our pre-registered plan, we used factor scores on this unique factor as our index, where higher scores indicate greater job attachment.^[Appendix \@ref(app-attachmentindex) provides complete psychometric details including factor loading, reliability statistics, and convergent/discriminant validity evidence. Results analyzing individual items separately (Appendix \@ref(app-cov) and \@ref(app-full-wmt)) show consistent treatment effects across all components, supporting the composite index approach.]

We use the standard and widely used union vote intention question as our indicator of union support [@kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019a; @ahlquistRiseUnionCurious2024; @freemanWhatUnions1984]: "If an election were held today to decide whether employees like you should be represented by a union at [EMPLOYER], would you vote for the union or against the union?" Responses are in \{for the union, against the union, not sure\}. The union vote question taps a concrete behavioral intention, not an abstract attitude. The question reflects the union certification voting process in the US, giving it strong face validity.

In Study 3 only, we also asked: "What percent of your coworkers do you think would vote FOR a union if there were an election today?" (0-100 scale). This captures perceptions of collective support distinct from personal voting intentions.

## Analytical approach

The main quantities of interest are the average treatment effects (ATE) for each of the EHF treatment relative to control for each of the outcome variables. However, a substantial portion of each sample was already aware of their employer's EHF before entering the experiment. These "pre-exposed" workers may respond differently than workers learning about the EHF for the first time [@druckmanLearningMorePolitical2012a; @ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023].^[I will use the terms "aware" and "pre-exposed" interchangeably.]  I therefore also consider heterogeneity in treatment effects based on pre-exposure to the EHF.^[Pre-exposure can also be viewed through the lens of compliance with treatment assignment; the pre-exposed are "always takers" while the un-exposed are "compliers".  Since we have direct measures of pre-exposure, however, the heterogeneous effects approach is more natural.]

One might object that the measurement of EHF awareness is itself a form of priming or pre-exposure in the survey. There are three reasons why this is not a serious concern here.  First, the elicitation of EHF awareness is subtle, embedded in longer list of potential job benefits, and avoids using the program's name.  Second, if there were a meaningful priming effect from the EHF awareness question, we would expect to see minimal differences between the aware and un-aware.  Instead, we observe that the pre-exposed are systematically different in terms of mean outcome levels and treatment effects from the un-exposed.  Third, to the extent that there is a priming or contamination from the EHF awareness question, it would reduce any detectable treatment effects or differences between the aware and unaware respondents. Thus my estimates are, if anything, downward biased and my conclusions are conservative.

Thus, to examine effect heterogeneity for outcome $j$ by pre-exposure for respondent $i$, we estimate: 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y_{ij}] = f(\alpha + \beta_1 T_i + \beta_2 P_i + \beta_3 T_iP_i + \beta_4 X_i)
(\#eq:reg)
\end{equation}
where $T_i$ denotes treatment condition and $P_i$ indicated pre-exposed to the employer's EHF. Assuming $f(x) = x$, we estimate \@ref(eq:reg) using OLS, in which case $\beta_1$ is the "average information effect" [@ferrariMethodologicalApproachCausal2023], i.e., the effects of the treatments among those who were previously unexposed.  The quantity $(\beta_1+\beta_3)$ represent the treatment effect among those who were aware of the EHF prior to the survey experiment. 

The assumption needed to sustain a causal interpretation of the treatment is that pre-exposure to information about the EHF is independent of potential outcomes, conditional on treatment and relevant pre-treatment covariates. This is plausible given pre-exposure primarily reflects job tenure (which we control) and the list-based awareness measure precedes treatment. However, we cannot definitively rule out that pre-exposed and unexposed workers differ on unobserved characteristics that moderate treatment effects.

We estimate equation \@ref(eq:reg) using OLS with robust standard errors for financial security and job attachment and multinomial logistic regression for the trichotomous union vote. I report three models for each outcome: one that includes only the experimental treatment indicators, providing ATE estimates; one that adds a treatment-by-awareness interaction term, and a third that also includes a suite of pre-registered pre-treatment covariates.^[Full reporting of the covariate coefficient estimates appears in appendices]


## Results: Study 2 (Home Depot)
We begin by examining treatment effects on each outcome, then assess heterogeneity by pre-exposure.

### Financial security

Recall that H1 predicts EHF information should improve workers' sense of financial security. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-finsec) displays the distribution of responses by treatment condition;  vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals.  Just under 40% of Home Depot respondents expressed concern about their ability to meet this financial challenge, in line with recent estimates [@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemEconomicWellBeingHouseholds2023].

```{r fig-finsec, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subjective financial security by treatment status for the Home Depot sample", out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '4_insecurity_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
p.ord
```

There is no evidence that EHF information affects financial security. If anything, the video treatment produces slightly more pessimism (though not statistically distinguishable from zero). Table \@ref(tab:tab-finsec) confirms this null finding across all specifications. Neither text nor video treatment shifts financial security perceptions.

```{r tab-finsec, echo=FALSE, tab.cap="OLS regression estimates of treatment effects on subjective financial security at the Home Depot."}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', 'insecurity_models.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
model_print_uw

```

Interestingly, workers who were pre-exposed to the Homer Fund report significantly higher financial security. On average their self report is higher than the unaware by about 0.5 standard deviations or half the average distance between outcome categories, even after controlling for tenure and other predictors of awareness. This correlation is consistent with the Homer Fund improving security, but the lack of experimental effects suggests the relationship may be spurious (e.g., more financially secure workers stay employed at the Home Depot longer or pay more attention to benefits information).  We also examined an alternative measure—self-reported difficulty paying monthly bills—and found identical null results (Appendix \@ref(app-bills)).  Across both measures, exposing Home Depot workers to Homer Fund information does not shift their subjective financial security. H1 is not supported.

### Job attachment

Table \@ref(tab:tab-aithd-models) presents OLS regression estimates of treatment effects on the job attachment index.  On average, the text treatment had no detectable effect, but the video treatment increased average job attachment by 0.28 on the index scale, or about 27% of a control group standard deviation.  We also uncover important heterogeneity by pre-exposure status.  Those pre-exposed to the EHF were significantly more positive about their Home Depot job than the un-exposed by about 60% of a standard deviation, even accounting for predictors of EHF awareness. In contrast to findings for financial security, we recover positive and significant treatment effects for job attachment.

```{r tab-aithd-models, echo=FALSE, tab.cap="OLS regression estimates of treatment effects on job attachment at the Home Depot."}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '6_loyalty_models.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
model_print_thd_uw_attachment
```

However, the pre-exposure interactions reveal important heterogeneity. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-THD-effattach) displays average predicted outcomes by treatment and pre-exposure status, derived from the covariate model and averaging over the values of the covariates in the sample. Among workers who were unaware of the Homer Fund before the survey, the video treatment produces a large positive effect (approximately 40% of an SD). Among workers already aware of the Homer Fund, treatment effects vanish; exposure to additional information does not further increase attachment. This pattern makes theoretical sense: emotional messages are more impactful for those learning something new compared to those already informed. It also suggests that treatment effects operate, in part, through learning about the program's impact on a specific person, not through repeated exposure or persuasion (which might work even on pre-exposed workers).

```{r fig-attachment-plot-thd, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Treatment effects on job attachment", out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '5_loyalty_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
p.ai_thd
```

```{r fig-THD-effattach, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Interpreting treatment effects on Home Depot job attachment by EHF pre-exposure status", out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
THDattach_eff_plot
```

Examining individual components of the attachment index (Appendix \@ref(app-cov) and \@ref(app-full-wmt)), we find consistent positive effects of the video treatment across loyalty to coworkers, loyalty to employer, and willingness to recommend, although the employer loyalty effect is smaller and marginally significant.

For Home Depot, H4 is supported: EHF messages increase job attachment, particularly among previously unaware workers. The effect size is substantively meaningful. This occurs despite no improvement in financial security, suggesting the mechanism is symbolic or affective rather than material.


### Support for unionization

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uv-thd) shows union vote intentions by treatment condition. Home Depot workers are generally skeptical of unions: only `r 100*round(summary_tab_uw_c$prounion,2)`%  of control respondents reporting a willingness to vote for a union and `r 100*round(summary_tab_uw_c$antiunion,2)`% voting against (the remainder answered "not sure").  This is substantially more anti-union than retail workers generally (Study 1 found `r round(100*genpop_engage_sum$union_support)`% would vote for a union) or even Walmart workers (see below). 

```{r fig-uv-thd,eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Support for unionization by treatment status in the Home Depot sample", out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '7_uiuv_summary_plots.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
uv_plot
```

The video treatment visibly shifts responses away from "for the union" toward "not sure"—but not toward greater opposition. The text treatment shows similar patterns but weaker.  On average, the video treatment makes respondents more _uncertain_ about their support for unionization.  The fact that respondents chose to answer the question (as opposed to skipping it) suggests that the video treatment increased uncertainty, not disinterest.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv) reports multinomial logistic regression results.  In the base model we see that video treatment, on average, produces an increase in the "not sure" responses, echoing Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uv-thd).  Once we account for pre-exposure, a clearer pattern emerges. Those aware of the EHF prior to the experiment were _already_ significantly less supportive of unions than the unexposed. Among workers unaware of the Homer Fund, both treatments significantly reduce pro-union responses, with effects concentrated in the video condition.  Including covariates that are predictive of pre-exposure does not alter conclusions.    

```{r tab-uv, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, tab.cap="Multinomial logit regression models on support for unionization "}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'THD', '8_uv_models.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

multinom_tab

```

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uveff) translates these logit coefficients into predicted probabilities by pre-exposure status. Among the previously unaware (left column), the video treatment more than halves predicted union support from about `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[1,"prob.For.the.union"])`% to `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[3,"prob.For.the.union"])`%. This effect does not come from increasing active opposition but rather from making workers uncertain. The proportion answering "not sure" grows from  `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[1,"prob.Not.sure"])`% to almost `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[3,"prob.Not.sure"])`%.

Among workers already aware of the Homer Fund (right column), treatment effects differ. The pre-exposed are already less supportive of unions on average, and additional exposure to Homer Fund messaging does not further shift reduce this low support.  But it does increase uncertainty from `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[4,"prob.Not.sure"])`% to almost `r round(100*eff_probs$prob[6,"prob.Not.sure"])`%

```{r fig-uveff, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Interpreting heterogeneous treatment effects on union support (Home Depot sample)", out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
#dev.new(width = 6000, height = 1500, unit = "px")
print(mnl_eff_plot)

```

H2 is supported at Home Depot: EHF information reduces support for unionization. However, the mechanism is not converting pro-union workers to anti-union positions. Instead, exposure to EHF messaging increases ambivalence--workers who might have supported a union become uncertain. This could reflect several processes: EHF information reminds workers of employer benefits, raises doubts about what unions would add, or signals employer responsiveness that makes unions seem less necessary.  The concentration of effects among previously unaware workers is again theoretically sensible but has important implications: the Homer Fund may be most effective at shaping attitudes of workers who haven't yet developed strong attachments or opinions.

### Summary: Home Depot findings

At Home Depot, exposure to realistic EHF information produces no effect on financial security (H1 rejected) but significantly increases job attachment (H4 supported) and reduces union support (H2 supported). Effects are concentrated among workers previously unaware of the program and are stronger for video than text treatments, suggesting emotional, narrative messaging matters more than factual description.

The findings reveal a paradox: Homer Fund messages increase worker loyalty without increasing perceived financial security. This suggests EHFs operate through symbolic or affective channels—signaling employer care, fostering perceived reciprocity, or invoking solidarity--rather than by credibly reducing economic precarity.

## Results: Study 3 (Walmart)
Study 3 follows an identical analytic approach with Walmart workers. Under H5 EHF effects depend on program generosity and cultural integration. Walmart's EHF should therefore produce weaker effects or backfire.


### Financial security

```{r}
ee.prop<-summarise(wmt.hq_wgt_f, 
          survey_mean(emergency_expense_num >0.5))
```

Walmart workers are notably more financially precarious than Home Depot workers, with `r round(100*(1-ee.prop$coef))`% expressing concern about their ability to meet a \$400 emergency expense, 25 percentage points higher than among Home Depot workers.  This aligns with other indicators: in our samples, 35% of Walmart respondents reported accessing government welfare programs in the past year versus 20% at Home Depot.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-finsec-wmt) displays OLS regression-based estimates of treatment effects on financial security. As at Home Depot, there are no detectable effects. The pre-exposed report greater financial resilience (0.1 scale points or 0.27 control group standard deviations), but treatment does not shift beliefs among either aware or unaware workers.

```{r tab-finsec-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Financial Security (Walmart)"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '7_attachment_summary_plots_WMT.R')
source(temp)

temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '10_insecurity_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

model_print_sec_wmt

#temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '7_attachment_summary_plots_WMT.R')
#source(temp)
#rm(temp)
```

H1 remains unsupported. Across both firms, intensive, realistic EHF messages do not improve subjective financial security, the programs' stated purpose.

### Job attachment

In addition to feeling more financially precarious, Walmart respondents express lower baseline job attachment than Home Depot workers.  For example, the net promoter score among the Walmart control respondents was `r 100*round(nps[[1]],2)`%, seven percentage points lower than at the Home Depot.^[Net promoter score is % promoters - % detractors for the recommend employer question, a common indicator of aggregate support.]  This suggests that Walmart workers are coming in to the survey with a more negative set of experiences and expectations about their employer than the Home Depot sample, consistent with the description of corporate culture from @sullMeasuringCultureLeading2019.  

Table \@ref(tab:tab-attachment-models-wmt) presents treatment effects on the attachment index. We continue to see that those pre-exposed to the EHF are more attached to their jobs, even after conditioning on predictors of EHF awareness. But the ACNT video treatment produces a small, effect on job attachment that is indistinguishable from zero. There is no evidence of heterogeneity by pre-exposure.

```{r tab-attachment-models-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Job attachment (Walmart)"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '8_attachment_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)

model_print_attachment_hq
```

Examining individual components (Appendix \@ref(app-full-wmt)) shows similar null results across loyalty to coworkers, loyalty to employer, willingness to recommend, and quit intentions. The ACNT message simply does not move these attitudes.  H4 is not supported at Walmart. This contrasts sharply with Home Depot, but it's consistent with H5 (contingency): messages about a low-generosity, minimally promoted ACNT embedded in a cost-control culture fails to generate attachment effects.

Why might this be? There a several possibilities, including (1) The ACNT is just not generous enough to be meaningful to workers; (2) the lack of authentic employer promotion makes our adapted video seem disingenuous, or (3) workers perceive inconsistency between ACNT messaging and their broader experiences at Walmart. We cannot distinguish among these with available data, but all are consistent with CSR research showing effects depend on perceived sincerity and alignment with broader organizational practices [@cassarIntentionsDoingGood2021; @burbanoMitigatingGigRemote2022].

<!---
In the Walmart sample, we also asked respondents about a hypothetical job offer at another retailer with better amenities, following the same pattern as in Study 1.  In Table \@ref(), we look at treatment effects from the survey experiment on how seriously the respondent would consider a job that offered "emergency cash assistance in hard times" a respondent places on
--->

### Support for unionization

Walmart workers are substantially more pro-union than Home Depot workers: 44% of control respondents would vote for a union versus 25% at Home Depot. Only 18% actively oppose unions.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv-models-wmt) displays results for a multinomial logistic regression on willingness to vote for unionization. The ACNT video produces a marginally significant decrease in opposition to unions. Adding pre-exposure generates notably worse-fitting models while still producing a negative but less precisely estimated effect on anti-union vote intentions.^[Appendix \@ref(app-full-wmt) displays full covariate estimates for both the model with covariates but no pre-exposure terms and the "covariate" model reported in Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv-models-wmt).  The model excluding pre-exposure terms is the better fitting based on the AIC and BIC.  In this preferred model, the estimated treatment effect and standard error are quite close to the base model in Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv-models-wmt).]   

```{r tab-uv-models-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Support for unionization (Walmart)"}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '12_uv_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
multinom_tab_wmt
```

We use the base model to generate predicted probabilities. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-uv-models-wmt) displays the estimated _difference_ between treatment and control in the predicted probability of choosing each outcome category.  On average, the ACNT treatment video lowered the probability of voting against the union from about 21% to 16%. The proportion voting "for the union" increases from 43% to 47%, absorbing most of the shift. The "not sure" category changes minimally. 

```{r fig-uv-models-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Treatment effect on support for unionization with 95% confidence intervals (Walmart)", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
temp<-here::here('2_code', 'Walmart', '12_uv_models_WMT.R')
source(temp)
rm(temp)
wmt_mnl_uv_interp
```

The effect on expected union support among co-workers tells a similar story. Table \@ref(tab:tab-usupp-models-wmt) shows the ACNT video increases Walmart workers' estimates of the proportion of their coworkers voting for a union by about 4 percentage points on a baseline of 50%. This suggests the video makes workers perceive unionization as more viable or acceptable among their peers.


```{r tab-usupp-models-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, tab.cap="Treatment effects on expected union support among co-workers"}
union_supp_pct_tab_wmt
```

These findings directly contradict H2. At Walmart, EHF messages reduce _opposition_ to unions rather than reducing support. This is the opposite of what we observed at Home Depot.

How do we explain this reversal? The most plausible interpretation invokes H5: when an EHF appears inadequate or inconsistent with corporate culture, it backfires. Workers at Walmart may interpret ACNT messaging as highlighting the gap between rhetoric and reality. The video may inadvertently underscore workers' precarity and Walmart's inadequate response, making collective action seem more attractive rather than less. Or the video's emphasis on mutual aid may combine with their experience on to job to increase rather than decrease receptivity to unions. We cannot definitively distinguish these mechanisms, but the backfire is clear and substantively important.

### Summary: Walmart findings

In Study 3, EHF information produces no effects on financial security or job attachment but reduces opposition to unionization, the opposite of Home Depot's union effects. This stark contrast occurs despite using comparable methods and measures across firms. The findings are consistent with H5 (contingency). An EHF that appears token or inconsistent with workplace culture can produce effects opposite to employers' presumed intentions.

## Comparing findings across firms

Table \@ref(tab:tab-results-summary) summarizes experimental results from Studies 2 and 3:

```{r tab-results-summary, echo=FALSE}
results_summary <- data.frame(
  Outcome = c("Financial Security", 
              "Job Attachment", 
              "Union vote ",
              "E[Coworker Union Support]"),
  Home_Depot = c("No effect",
                 "+0.6 SD among previously unaware workers",
                 "-10 pp among unaware (reduces 'for union,' increases 'not sure')",
                 "Not measured"),
  Walmart = c("No effect",
              "No effect",
              "-5 pp opposition (reduces 'against union,' increases 'for union')",
              "+4 pp "),
  H5_Consistent = c("No",
                    "Yes",
                    "Yes",
                    "Yes")
)

kable(results_summary,
      col.names = c("Outcome", "Home Depot Effect", "Walmart Effect", 
                    "Consistent with H5?"),
      caption = "Summary of Experimental Findings Across Firms",
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position", "striped"),
                font_size = 10) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "3.5cm") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "4cm") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "4cm") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "2.5cm")
```

The pattern is clear: messages about Home Depot's relatively generous, heavily promoted, and better integrated Homer Fund increases attachment and reduces union support. Walmart's minimal, weakly promoted ACNT generates no attachment benefit and backfires on unionization. Neither program affects subjective financial security.

These differences cannot be attributed to differences in sampling, measurement, or experimental treatments alone. We used identical recruitment methods, comparable measures, and analytic approaches. The most parsimonious explanation is that program characteristics and cultural context fundamentally shape how workers interpret and respond to EHF information.

This has important implications for understanding EHFs as governance tools. They are not universally effective instruments for building loyalty or discouraging unionization. Their effects seem contingent, depending at minimum on perceived generosity, promotion intensity, and consistency with broader employment practices. Implemented poorly, they may highlight employer inadequacy rather than benevolence.


### Additional considerations: timing, and effect perisitance
 
We briefly discuss two additional considerations.  

<!-- First, in Study 2, we saw 30% ($n=$) of workers who reported donating to the Homer Fund failing to identify emergency cash assistance as a job amenity.  We interpreted this as evidence that respondents in the Home Depot survey were aware of the Homer Fund, but they appear to connect it more with corporate-sponsored charity than a benefit that they might use. So a "thin" understanding of the EHF may be responsible.  An alternative interpretation is simply that these are inattentive respondents (notwithstanding passing attention checks). Appendix XX shows regression results for results excluding these potentially inattentive respondents. Effects on attachment and union support remain significant and slightly stronger, suggesting measurement error attenuates rather than creates our findings. -->

First, Study 2 occurred during the pandemic recovery (Fall 2021) while Study 3 occurred post-pandemic (Fall 2024). Could this explain differences? This is unlikely for several reasons: (1) effects on financial security are null in both studies despite economic conditions differing, (2) the pandemic arguably increased the salience of mutual aid, which should strengthen not weaken EHF effects, and (3) union support appears to have been rising nationally since before the pandemic [@ahlquistRiseUnionCurious2024;@sojournerAmericansFavorLabor2025], yet we observe opposite treatment effects in the two firms. Timing may add noise but does not obviously explain the pattern.

Second, to investigate effect persistence, Study 3 included a pre-registered one-week follow-up survey.  We received follow up surveys from only 157 respondents (16% response rate). Among this group, union support effects were no longer detectable after a week (see Appendix \@ref(app:app-followup-wmt)).  The under-powered follow up survey limits our ability to draw strong conclusions, but it is unsurprising that effects generated raising EHF salience might be short-lived. Nevertheless, even short-term effects could matter if they occur during union organizing campaigns.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This paper documents Employee Hardship Funds, a widespread but unstudied organizational practice that blends worker mutual aid with inward-oriented CSR.  We provide the first systematic evidence on how these programs affect workers. 
Three findings stand out. First, worker awareness is modest despite strong interest. Only 23% of retail workers claim that their employer offers emergency cash assistance, yet when explained, workers value EHFs as highly as improved health insurance.  At Walmart, the majority of workers were unaware of this amenity. Why does a benefit workers value remain so invisible? Mechanisms could include optimism bias, employers misunderstanding the available benefits, or strategic awareness management.

Second, realistic EHF messages can increase job attachment without improving  financial security---our central paradox. At Home Depot, exposure to Homer Fund messages significantly increased job attachment and reduced support for unionization among previously unaware workers yet had no effect on confidence in covering a $400 expense. Workers seem to respond to symbolic signals of workplace aid independent of direct material security improvements.  How do programs generate attachment without addressing the economic precarity they ostensibly target?

Third, EHF effects are context-contingent. Messages about the Home Depot's generous, heavily promoted, and culturally integrated EHF produced the expected governance effects. Walmart's less generous program in a cost-control culture produced no attachment gains and reduced opposition to unions---the opposite of presumed employer interests. With  two firms we cannot isolate the features that drive differences, but the contrast shows that program design and cultural context matter.  Like high performance work systems, inward-CSR is a bundle of practices, not an isolated intervention [@macduffieHumanResourceBundles1995; @ichniowskiEffectsHumanResource1997].

For managers, a well-designed and promoted EHF can strengthen employee attachment, but token programs risk highlighting inadequacy rather than demonstrating care.  A key challenge is striking the right balance between verifying actual need and rapid delivery of emergency funds.^[An executive at a third-party EHF provider bluntly stated that "I think a program with a low grant application approval rate does more harm than good to the employee-employer relationship."]  More direct worker involvement in EHF design and operation is another area for innovation.  

For policymakers, EHFs illustrate that private welfare can supplement but not substitute for robust public social insurance. They also highlight how existing safety nets often fail to deliver during acute need. Finally, we have no evidence for whether the public benefits of EHFs justify their tax-advantaged status.

Our study has important limitations. We measure only short-term attitudes, not long-term behavior.  Our samples under-represent the most precarious workers. With two firms we can observe that effects vary across organizational contexts, but cannot pinpoint the full causal process. To make progress, future research will need to track workers longitudinally, exploit variation in EHF adoption timing, examine behavioral outcomes, and study larger samples varying systematically in program characteristics, all difficult tasks. 

The central paradox captures something fundamental about contemporary employment relationships. In precarious labor markets with weak public safety nets, gestures toward mutual aid can generate job attachment even if actual improvements to workers' economic security are fleeting or non-existent. EHFs may represent genuine assistance when public support falls short or a strategy for cultivating attachment while sustaining precarious employment. But the evidence suggests caution: the EHFs studied here function as governance tools that shape worker attitudes while delivering modest, discretionary aid. As corporations expand their role in welfare provision, understanding whether these arrangements serve worker interests or merely employer control becomes essential.

# More Background on EHFs and EHF third party providers {#app-3rd}

In 2001, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) amended its rules to allow employer-controlled non-profit foundations to provide direct cash assistance to employees who under certain conditions, called a "qualifying event". Funds can only be used for basic living expenses (food, clothing, transportation, housing/house repair, burial) for the recipient and immediate family [@internalrevenueserviceDisasterReliefProviding2014; @aprillCharitableClassDisaster2016]. So long as these guidelines are followed, EHFs are tax-exempt charities; donations are tax deductible.  
 
There are now multiple organizations that provide EHF outsourcing services to firms.  Beyond the Employee Assistance Foundation, I have identified E4E Relief, America's Charities, and Canary.  EAF appears to be the largest and claims to have over 400 clients [@employeeassistancefoundationDecadeAssistanceOffering2022]. 
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-tpm) illustrates the scale and growth of EHFs using data from IRS 990 forms.^[If a firm contracts with a third party to administer an EHF program, all donations and grants are linked to the third party contractor's EIN, not the original firm.  With a large number of employers offering EHFs through third party providers, we cannot systematically identify firms with and without EHFs through IRS 990 filings.] Figure \@ref(fig:fig-tpm) compares the revenues and total grants paid out to individuals from four EHF outsourcing organizations.  EAF, the oldest and largest, has grown rapidly since first appearing in IRS data in 2012, reaching over \$144 million in revenue and \$86 million in grants to individuals in 2020. The data also show the recent entry of several competitor organizations, with E4E and America's Charities operating a similar scales in recent years and Canary growing rapidly.

# Measurement {#app-measurement}

This appendix provides detailed information on all measures used in Studies 1-3, including item wording, response scales, and psychometric properties.

## Item wording and response scales for key outcome variables

### EHF Awareness (List-based measure) {#app-HFaware}

Our preferred "list-based" measure of EHF awareness comes from a question in which respondents were shown a list of eight workplace benefits and programs and asked: *"Employers sometimes create programs or offer benefits for their workers. Which of the benefits on this list are offered to workers like you at [Employer name]? Please select all that apply."*

The list varied slightly by survey:

- Paid sick days
- Paid vacation days
- Health plan or medical insurance  
- A retirement plan other than Social Security
- **Emergency cash assistance to help in unexpected hard times** [Study 1,3]/ **Cash grant to help in times of financial emergency** [Study 2]
- Paid parental leave
- Free or subsidized childcare [Study 1, 3]/Company provided or subsidized childcare [Study 2]
- Tuition discount or reimbursement for schooling [Study 1, 3]
- None of these [Study 2]

**Coding:** Respondents who selected the bolded item were coded as aware of EHF (1 = aware, 0 = not aware).

We used the list-based approach to two main reasons.  First, we wanted to avoid contaminating the experiment by priming respondents pre-treatment, so we embedded the item in a longer list and did not use the program name.  Second, this approach avoids problems with demand effects.   

To provide bounds on awareness, we asked other questions of subsets of the respondents.  In studies 2 & 3, control group respondents saw no information about the EHF in the survey.  One measure of prior EHF awareness is therefore the proportion of control group respondents who answer "yes" to a direct question about whether their employer has an EHF. In Study 2, we asked control group respondents only the following: 
> "Some companies have programs that take donations and provide emergency cash to help workers like you through hard times. Does The Home Depot offer a program like this for workers like you?"  

On this basis, I estimate the weighted proportion of Home Depot control-condition respondents who report knowing about the EHF as `r round(aware_tab$aware.prop.s,2)` (se = `r round(aware_tab$aware.prop.s_se,2)`).  The difference in estimated awareness produced by the this measure of awareness and the list approach used in the main text is striking.  Among those in the control group correctly answering "yes" to the direct question about their employer's EHF, `r round(100*aware_xt["FALSE","Yes"]/sum(aware_xt[,"Yes"]),0)`% _failed_ to identify the cash grant program as one of their job benefits whereas nearly all of those correctly choosing the cash grant program from the list of benefits also correctly answered direct question.  Consequently, I interpret the lower estimate based on the "list" question as the more accurate reflection of EHF awareness.  Using the list measure of awareness, we estimate that 58% of the Home Depot sample control condition respondents are aware.  This suggested that the direct questions capture vague awareness, possibly combined with some demand effects, rather than functional understanding of the program.

In Study 3, we refined the question ordering such that we asked all respondents the direct questions about whether Walmart has an EHF.  We were careful to implement this question after the survey experiment and answers to key outcome questions.  As shown in Appendix \@ref(app:app-manip-wmt), both correctly answering the list-based awareness question and video treatment are strongly predictive of a correct answer in the direct question, as expected.  For comparability to Study 2, in Study 3  among those in the control group correctly answering "yes" to the direct question about their employer's EHF, `r round(100*aware_wmt_xt["FALSE","Yes"]/sum(aware_wmt_xt[,"Yes"]),0)`% _failed_ to identify the cash grant program as one of their job amenities.  Of those recorded as "pre-exposed", `r round(100*sum(aware_wmt_cntrl_xt["TRUE","Yes"])/sum(aware_wmt_cntrl_xt["TRUE",]))`% correctly answered yes to the direct question and `r round(100*sum(aware_wmt_cntrl_xt["TRUE","No"])/sum(aware_wmt_cntrl_xt["TRUE",]))` incorrectly answered "no", with the balance saying they were not sure (a response option not available to the control respondents in Study 2).


### EHF engagement
The EHF engagement questions were asked of different subsets of the of respondents in Study 2 and 3, based on question ordering and a desire to avoid any contamination of the experiment.

*"Do you know someone personally who has received money from [EHF name]?* 

*"Have you ever applied to the [EHF name] for financial assistance?"* 

*"Have you ever received financial assistance from the [EHF name]?"*

*"Have you ever made a donation to the [EHF name]"*

Response scale:  Yes, No, Don't know

In Study 2, the "know beneficiary" and "applied" questions were only presented to treated respondents.  The donate and grant receipt question were asked of all respondents (post treatment).  In these latter two questions, rates of reported donation and receipt were nearly identical among the treated and control groups.   

Study 3 differed from Study 2 in that we asked all Walmart respondents (not just control respondents) whether their employer has an EHF (post-treatment).  Those incorrectly answering "No" were _not_ shown the EHF engagement questions.  Thus the subset of respondents reporting EHF engagement differs somewhat between Studies 2 and 3.  Nevertheless, restricting the Study 2 sample to only treated respondents produces nearly quantities to those reported in the main text.  

### Financial Security

*"How confident are you that you could come up with $400 if an unexpected need arose within the next month?"*

Response scale:

1. I am certain I could not come up with \$400
2. I could probably not come up with \$400
3. I could probably come up with \$400
4. I am certain I could come up with the full \$400

This item is taken from the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED), where it has been used since 2013 to track financial fragility [@groverWhat400Emergency2021]. The \$400 threshold reflects realistic emergency expenses for low-wage workers and has become a standard benchmark in research on financial precarity.  This particular item correlates strongly with self-reported financial indicators such as bank account balances, debt levels, and employment shocks [@boardofgovernorsofthefederalreservesystemEconomicWellBeingHouseholds2023]. 

As a second indicator, Study 2 included the question, with responses "Not at all difficult", "Somewhat difficult", "Very difficult".

### Loyalty to coworkers and employer

*"How much loyalty would you say you feel toward other workers at [Employer]?"*

*"How much loyalty would you say you feel toward [Employer] as a company?"*

Response scale:

1. No loyalty at all
2. Only a little loyalty
3. Some loyalty
4. A lot of loyalty

Both loyalty questions are taken from @freemanWorkerRepresentationParticipation1998 and analyzed in @freemanSharedCapitalismWork2010.

### Willingness to Recommend Employer

*"If a friend asked you about working at [Employer] doing a job like yours, how likely is it that you would recommend [Employer] as a place to work?"*

Response scale:

1. Definitely would not recommend
2. Might not recommend
3. Not sure
4. Might recommend
5. Certainly would recommend

This item is adapted from the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology commonly used in customer and worker satisfaction research.

### Quit Intentions (Study 3 only)

*"Taking everything into consideration, how likely is it you will make a genuine effort to find a new job within the next 3 months?"*

Response scale:

1. Not at all likely
2. Not very likely
3. Somewhat likely
4. Very likely
5. Extremely likely

This item is the core quit intentions question used in the SHIFT Project [@schneiderWhatFacebookTool2019]. Note this item is reverse-scaled relative to other job attachment index questions.

### Union Vote Intention

*"If an election were held today to decide whether employees like you should be represented by a union at [EMPLOYER], would you vote for the union or against the union?"*

Response scale:

- For the union
- Against the union
- Not sure

This is the standard question used in research on support for unionization at work, with a long history in industrial relations research (see @kochanWorkerVoiceAmerica2019a, @ahlquistRiseUnionCurious2024, @freemanWhatUnions1984).  Vote intention is a concrete behavioral intention, not an abstract attitude. The question reflects the union certification voting process in the US, giving it strong face validity.

### Expected Coworker Union Support (Study 3 only)

*"If an election were held today to decide whether employees like you should be represented by a union at [Employer], what percent of your co-workers do you think would vote for the union?"*

Response scale: Open numeric response from 0 to 100.

## Job attachement index construction and reliability {#app-attachmentindex}

Our goal with the job attachment index is not to argue for a novel psychological concept and propose a measurement scale. Rather we seek to provide a coherent and concise indicator of affective attachment to a particular job, encompassing both horizontal ties to coworkers and vertical ties to the employer.  

There are multiple validated indices purporting to measure "organizational identification", "organizational commitment", "organizational citizenship", and related concepts and sub-scales [@oreillyOrganizationalCommitmentPsychological1986; @zhaoInfluenceCorporateSocial2022; @mowdayOrganizationalCommitmentQuestionnaire1979; @meyerOrganizationalCommitmentScales1993].  As we had limited survey space, multiple research goals, and limited prior information, we elected not to implement any of these detailed and lengthy instruments designed to measure concepts only loosely connected to our research goals. Instead we focus a few items with strong face validity and history of use in other surveys. 

We constructed a job attachment index from items measuring loyalty to coworkers, loyalty to employer, and willingness to recommend employer. In Study 3, we also included quit intentions (reverse-coded).

### Exploratory Factor Analysis

For both Studies 2 and 3, we conducted exploratory factor analysis on the index components.  In both cases, I use minimum residual factoring methods and the oblimin rotation.  As there are many criteria for selecting factor solutions, we look at the preferred solution across multiple different criteria [@ludeckeExtractingComputingExploring2020].  In both cases, a single factor solution is preferred.

#### Home Depot {#app-HFattachment}

```{r fig-fa-plot-thd, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
thd.jai.df<- THD_comp_uw[,c("wrk_loyal_num", "emp_loyal_num", "emp_reco_num")]
nf.thd <- parameters::n_factors(thd.jai.df)
plot(nf.thd)
```

```{r tab-fa-thd, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

fa.thd<-parameters::factor_analysis(thd.jai.df)
fa.thd.tab <- fa.thd |> 
  kable(
  format = "latex",
    booktabs = TRUE,
  digits = 2,
  col.names = c("Variable", "Loading", "Complexity", "Uniqueness"),
  caption = "Factor loadings and uniqueness from one-factor solution, Home Depot (study 2)"
)

fa.thd.tab

```

A single factor explains `r round(100*summary(fa.thd)$MR1[2])`% of the variance.  All items load substantively on the first factor (loadings >.60).

#### Walmart {#app-indexcomps-wmt}

```{r fig-fa-plot-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
wmt.jai.df<- wmt.hq[,c("wrk_loyal_num", "emp_loyal_num", "emp_reco_num", "new_job_num")]
nf.wmt <- parameters::n_factors(wmt.jai.df)
plot(nf.wmt)
```

```{r tab-fa-wmt, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

fa.wmt<-parameters::factor_analysis(wmt.jai.df)
fa.wmt.tab <- fa.wmt |> 
  kable(
  format = "latex",
    booktabs = TRUE,
  digits = 2,
  col.names = c("Variable", "Loadings", "Complexity", "Uniqueness"),
  caption = "Factor loadings and uniqueness from one-factor solution, Walmart (study 3)"
)
fa.wmt.tab
```

In the Walmart sample a single factor explains `r round(100*summary(fa.wmt)$MR1[2])`% of the variance.  All items load substantively on the first factor.  The quit intention variable loads negatively, as expected.

Reliability is good in both samples ($\alpha > .70$) as is inter-item correlations (in the .50 range), supporting the use of a composite index.  The factor structure across the Walmart and Home Depot samples appear quite similar in both loadings and variance explained. Both show a single dominant factor with comparable reliability.  Raw correlations between index items as well as other outcome variables appear in Appendices \@ref(app-survsum-uw) and \@ref(app-wmt-survsum).

# Manipulation checks for Walmart experiment {#app-manip-wmt}

## Correctly responding that Walmart has an EHF
In the Walmart sample, treatment significantly increased the probability that a respondent would correctly state that Walmart has an EHF. Note that the pre-exposed were much more likely to correctly identify that Walmart has an EHF.

At the end of Study 3, respondents had the opportunity to click on a link to take them to a page where they could donate to the ACNT. Based on past research [@andreoniPowerAskingHow2011], we expect those exposed to the emotional appeal in the video to be more willing to donate.  

In the Walmart sample, we see a low baseline willingness to click on the link of `r round(100*donation_summary$prop[1])`%.  Nevertheless, those seeing the EHF video were about 4 percentage points more likely to take an action to donate. Table \@ref(tab:tab-donate-models-wmt-app) presents regression-based estimates of treatment effects, using OLS and logistic regression.  We also include Firth regression to address concerns with rare events.  Treatment significantly increases willingness to take an action to donate.

# Follow-up survey (Walmart) {#app-followup-wmt}

We sent an email invitation to a followup survey to all Walmart survey respondents who provided an email.  In the end, we received `r sum(!is.na(wmt.hq$age_f))` or `r round(100*sum(!is.na(wmt.hq$age_f)) /nrow(wmt.hq))`% of those completing the main survey.

Table \@ref(tab:tab-fu-wmt) reports logistic regression estimates of selection into the followup survey based on binary and full treatment status in the main survey. There is no evidence the treatment in the main survey affected selection into the followup.

```


In Table \@ref(tab:tab-uv-models-fu-wmt),  I report mutinomial logistic regression results for the union support question, the only outcome included in the follow up for which there was a detectable treatment effect in the main survey.   The base model compares the union vote outcomes for respondents in the followup survey based on their treatment status in the original survey.  The second model reports the same model employing stabilized IPW weights, as pre-registered.^[IPW weights were calculated using a full treatment $\times$ covariate interaction logistic regression.]  In neither case is there any detectable effect one week later, but small samples combined with the sensitivity of point estimates to the IPW weights suggests that the followup survey is too under-powered for any strong conclusions to be drawn.
