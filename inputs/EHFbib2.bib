	abstract = {State interventions against organized criminal groups (OCGs) sometimes work to improve security, but often exacerbate violence. To understand why, this article offers a theory about criminal governance in five types of criminal regimes—Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and are associated with markedly different local security outcomes. We provide evidence of this theory by using a multimethod research design combining quasi-experimental statistical analyses, automated text analysis, extensive qualitative research, and a large-N survey in the context of Rio de Janeiro's “Pacifying Police Units” (UPPs), which sought to reclaim control of the favelas from criminal organizations.},

I show that this behavior is partially driven by affluent Americans' desire for social status. First, I use a new survey scale to show that affluent Americans' desire for social status strongly predicts their level of economic conservatism. Second, I test my theory experimentally in the context of social media. On sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, affluent Americans compete for social status by sharing curated versions of their lives that highlight their upper-class lifestyle. When I randomly assign affluent Americans to experience this status competition, it causes them to become more economically conservative. The results help us understand the social and psychological origins of economic conservatism among affluent Americans, and provide the first evidence that social media encourages political behaviors that are conducive to inequality.},

	abstract = {Monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) has earned the nickname “warrior gene” because it has been linked to aggression in observational and survey-based studies. However, no controlled experimental studies have tested whether the warrior gene actually drives behavioral manifestations of these tendencies. We report an experiment, synthesizing work in psychology and behavioral economics, which demonstrates that aggression occurs with greater intensity and frequency as provocation is experimentally manipulated upwards, especially among low activity MAOA (MAOA-L) subjects. In this study, subjects paid to punish those they believed had taken money from them by administering varying amounts of unpleasantly hot (spicy) sauce to their opponent. There is some evidence of a main effect for genotype and some evidence for a gene by environment interaction, such that MAOA is less associated with the occurrence of aggression in a low provocation condition, but significantly predicts such behavior in a high provocation situation. This new evidence for genetic influences on aggression and punishment behavior complicates characterizations of humans as “altruistic” punishers and supports theories of cooperation that propose mixed strategies in the population. It also suggests important implications for the role of individual variance in genetic factors contributing to everyday behaviors and decisions.},

Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the sel®sh motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation ¯ourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

There is considerable individual variation, however, in the degree that people report that their position on specific issues reflects a core moral conviction. This chapter reviews theory and research that explores the role moral conviction plays in predicting people's political thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Variance in moral conviction associated with specific issues has important social and political consequences, such as predicting increased political engagement (voting, willingness to engage in activism), inoculation against the usual pressures to obey authorities and the law, and greater acceptance of violent solutions to conflict. The normative implications of these and other findings are both reassuring (moral conviction can protect against obedience to potentially malevolent authorities) and terrifying (moral conviction is associated with rejection of the rule of law and can provide a motivational foundation for violent protest and acts of terrorism).},

	abstract = {This book is the result of a collaborative effort by eleven anthropologists and six economists, and questions the motives that underlie the ways that humans interact socially, and whether these are the same for all societies, and are part of our nature, or are influenced by our environments. Over the past decade, research in experimental economics has emphatically falsified the textbook representation of Homo economicus, with hundreds of experiments that have suggested that people care not only about their own material payoffs but also about such things as fairness, equity, and reciprocity. However, this research has left fundamental questions unanswered: are such social preferences stable components of human nature; or, are they modulated by economic, social, and cultural environments? Until now, experimental research could not address this question because virtually all subjects had been university students, and while there are cultural differences among student populations throughout the world, these differences are small compared with the full range of human social and cultural environments. A vast amount of ethnographic and historical research suggests that people's motives are influenced by economic, social, and cultural environments, yet such methods can only yield circumstantial evidence about human motives. In combining ethnographic and experimental approaches to fill this gap, this book breaks new ground in reporting the results of a large cross‐cultural study aimed at determining the sources of social (non‐selfish) preferences that underlie the diversity of human sociality. The same experiments that provided evidence for social preferences among university students were performed in fifteen small‐scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of social, economic, and cultural conditions by experienced field researchers who had also done long‐term ethnographic field work in these societies. The results, which are given in chs. 4 to 14, demonstrated no society in which experimental behaviour is consistent with the canonical model of self‐interest, and showed that variation in behaviour is far greater than previously thought, and that the differences between societies in market integration and the importance of cooperation explain a substantial portion of the variation found (which individual‐level economic and demographic variables could not). The results also trace the extent to which experimental play mirrors the patterns of interaction found in everyday life. The book has three introductory chapters that include a succinct but substantive introduction to the use of game theory as an analytical tool, and to its use in the social sciences for the rigorous testing of hypotheses about fundamental aspects of social behaviour outside artificially constructed laboratories, and an overview and summary of the results of the fifteen case studies.},

Across the national- and individual-level differences that extant research has used to explain the heuristic, people categorize welfare recipients on the basis of whether they are lazy or unlucky. This mode of categorization furthermore induces people to think about large-scale welfare politics as its presumed ancestral equivalent: small-scale help giving. The general implications for research on heuristics are discussed.},

We will ask you to look at pictures of these persons and to read what each one says. Try to gain an impression of each individual. Later, you will be asked to answer questions about them. On the next eight screens, respondents were presented with pictures of eight different individuals, one at a time, and read a short statement from each. Other than simply looking at the picture and reading the associated statement, the subjectswere not supposed to do anything. Each individual was presented on separate screens for 20 seconds, and the screen then automatically proceeded to the next individual. In the first two studies, all of the individuals were young males. In Study 3, there were four males and four females. This presence of female pictures is the only difference between Study 3 and the first two studies (see results section for further discussion). To picture the individuals, eight neutralized pictures of young faces were taken from the Center for Vital Longevity Face Database (Minear and Park 2004) and randomly paired with the statements for each subject. Each study involved two experimental conditions. The experimental manipulations related to the content of the statements expressed by the individuals. In the baseline condition, the statements revealed that each of the individuals were either (1) receiving welfare benefits from the state because of unemployment or (2) had some kind of everyday need that a friend helped them with. Four individuals were presented as welfare recipients and four others as receiving small-scale assistance. In the treatment condition, a statement was added to the baseline presentations which depicted each individual as either being low or high in effort. Specifically, the sentence indicated either (1) that the individual was not making an effort to alleviate the need himself (i.e., a “cheater”) or (2) that he was making an effort (i.e., a “reciprocator”). In the treatment condition, an equal number of welfare recipients and everyday help receivers were depicted as high and low in effort (specifically, two of each). Cheater: “I get support from the govcernment because I am out of work. I could easily find a job but to tell the truth, I prefer to do without all the hassle when money lands in my account anyway.” Reciproicator: ”I get support from the govcernment because I am out of work. I lost my job when I was injured at work a year ago, but I am doing all I can to get back in the labor market.” After the respondents had viewed the presentation of all eight individuals, they were confronted with a short distracter task before being introduced to the next task: a surprise recall task.Theywere told that theywould be presented with the statements, one at the time, made by the eight individuals and the images of all eight individuals. They were then asked to mark the image of the individual whomade the relevant statement. The order in which the statements from the presentation phase were presented was randomized. The subjects' answers were recorded. As is apparent from the above description, the [WSW] paradigm involves two phases: first, subjects are told that they are to be presented with a series of individuals and asked to form impressions about these individuals. The second phase is a surprise recall phase in which subjects are asked to pair the statements with the individuals, i.e., recall who said what. The crux of the method is that the analysis of the subjects' answers in the recall phase allows one to make inferences about how they have categorized the individuals in the presentation phase. the fundamental premise of the method is that subjects during recall more readily confuse individuals they have categorized together. Exact measures of categorization are calculated by comparing the number of within-category errors (e.g., when the statement of one “cheater” is attributed to another) with the number of between-category errors (e.g., when the statement of a “cheater” is attributed to a “reciprocator”). Statistically, the measure of categorization is basically calculated by subtracting the number of between-category errors from the number of withincategory errors (although it should be noted that—as is standard—different correction procedures are used prior to subtraction },

	abstract = {Public attitudes towards welfare policy are often explained by political values and perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients. This article addresses how the impact of values and perceptions varies depending on the contextual information that citizens have available when forming welfare opinions. It is argued that whenever citizens face deservingness-relevant cues in public debate or the media, a psychological `deservingness heuristic' is triggered prompting individuals spontaneously to think about welfare policy in terms of who deserves help.This is an automatic process, equally influential among the least and the most politically sophisticated. Moreover, when clear deservingness cues are present, the impact of values on opinions vanishes.These arguments are supported by data from two novel experimental studies embedded in separate nationwide opinion surveys. The findings revise conventional wisdom of how values and heuristics influence public opinion and have major implications for understanding dynamics in aggregate welfare opinion and attempts from political elites to manipulate public opinion.},

The control group enables us to assess reactions to the specific recipients more precisely. Second, we asked two questions designed to tap the perceived deservingness of each recipient directly.We asked whether the respondents agreed that `he (she) could get a job, if he (she) wanted to' and whether they agreed that `he (she) has contributed enough to deserve social welfare'},

Categorization level (Group vs. Personal) and Type of Game (PDG vs. CDG vs. TDG) constituted the 2 × 3 factorial design. As predicted from Social Identity Theory, Group Categorization elicited more cooperation than Personal Categorization. Additional data sustained a social identification interpretation. Second, it was investigated whether the rank order in cooperation among the three games, which were presented to the subjects in a lifelike format, would replicate the rank order observed in an abstract gaming study, and it did: in the PDG fewer cooperative choices were made than in the CDG, whereas in the CDG fewer cooperative choices were made than in the TDG.},

The results showed that group categorization elicited more cooperation than personal categorization. The process by which the categorization effect on choice behavior was obtained remained unclear, however. “ How they induced group identity: framing. In the Personal Categorization condition the instructions said that the computer would repeat the flip-of-the-coin procedure 570 times, once independently for each person: subjects selected by the computer would receive their personally acquired tokens. In the Group Categorization condition the instructions said that the computer would repeat the flip-of-the-coin procedure 57 times, once independently for each group: all subjects in groups selected by the computer would receive their personally acquired tokens.

We find that behavior in conflict depends on whether one is harmed by actions perpetrated by the out-group, but not on one׳s own influence on the outcome of the out-group. The perceived target of threat dramatically alters decisions to participate in conflict. When people perceive their group to be under threat, they are mobilized to do what is good for the group and contribute to the conflict. On the other hand, if people perceive to be personally under threat, they are driven to do what is good for themselves and withhold their contribution. The first phenomenon is attributed to group identity, possibly combined with a concern for social welfare. The second phenomenon is attributed to a novel victim effect. Another social motive—reciprocity—is ruled out by the data.},

Second, for group identity and cooperation to emerge in conflict, it is crucial that the group, rather than individual group members, is perceived to be under threat. When the objectively same threat is perceived as imposed separately on the individual group members, they are less likely to cooperate.” (p. “In our experimental PD game, each of three players in the group receives an initial endowment of 140 ECU (Experimental Currency Units) and decides whether to contribute to a group account or not.

The IPD game maintains this payoff structure within the group. The gain of the in-group members, however, is at the expense of members of a matched group.

In this game group members can contribute to the ingroup (at a personal cost) and benefit ingroup members with or without harming members of an outgroup. Additionally, we devised a novel version of the IPD-MD in which the choice is between benefiting ingroup members with or without helping members of the outgroup. Our results show an overall reluctance to display outgroup hate by actively harming outgroup members, except when the outgroup was morality-based.

In recent years, the concept has been measured in other racial and ethnic groups and with regard to gender, but not applied to social statuses such as class or religion. Without broad comparisons across groups and different statuses, however, one cannot determine the appropriate empirical test or most distinctive correlates of this canonical construct. Using a new national survey, we examine Americans' views of linked fate by race or ethnicity, and also by gender, class, or religion. We find expressions of linked fate to be similar across racial or ethnic groups, robust to experimental manipulation, and as strong for class as for racial or ethnic identity. Intra-individual correlations on linked fate items are very high, while a sense of linked fate is rarely associated with political views or political participation. Expressions of linked fate are not always closely related to feelings of closeness to one's group or perceptions of discrimination against that group. We speculate on the broader meaning of responses to this standard item, and conclude that the enormously fruitful theory of racial linked fate is due for further conceptual development and empirical experimentation.},

In a setting where collec- tive action is risky and where success requires the participation of a large number of citizens, exit options reduce mobilization through two mechanisms. First, profitable migration opportunities raise the opportunity cost of collective action, dampening po- litical participation among those who could migrate. In addition, the knowledge that some individuals have profitable exit options lowers everyone's confidence that collec- tive action can be successful. Because of this, all people—regardless of whether they personally could migrate—become less likely to mobilize as exit options become more profitable or more prevalent, undermining collective action and making successful mo- bilization less likely.

Since the 1970s, the majority of less-developed countries have adopted policies that aim to limit internal migration. This Element marshals evidence from around the world to explore the colliding trends of internal migration and nativism. Subnational migration is associated with a boom in nativist politics.

It argues that industrial relations research could learn from two neighbouring scholarly communities: global labour studies and historical institutionalist research on comparative political economy. Research in these two fields, the article contends, offers models for distinguishing between the respective roles of ideas, interests and institutions in workers' attempts to build and mobilize labour power. Structuring research on innovation in collective action around these conceptual focal points could facilitate the accumulation of knowledge about organized labour's ongoing global reorientation.},

Far from being freely chosen, student internships are organized by the local state working with enterprises and schools, frequently in violation of the rights of student interns and in violation of Chinese law. Foxconn, through direct deals with government departments, has outsourced recruitment to vocational schools to obtain a new source of student workers at below minimum wages. The goals and timing of internships are set not by student educational or training priorities but by the demand for products dictated by companies. Based on fieldwork in Sichuan and Guangdong between 2011 and 2012 and follow-up interviews in 2014, as well as analysis of the Henan government's policies on internships, we find that the student labor regime has become integral to the capital-state relationship as a means to assure a lower cost and flexible labor supply for Foxconn and others.

We examine the past three decades, during which population pressures contributed to substantial labor flows from neighboring countries into the United States and Europe, and contrast them with the coming three decades, which will see sharp reductions in labor-supply growth in Latin America but not in Africa or much of the Middle East. Using a gravity-style empirical model, we examine the contribution of changes in relative labor-supply to bilateral migration in the 2000s and then apply this model to project future bilateral flows based on long-run UN forecasts of working-age populations in sending and receiving countries. Because the Americas are entering an era of uniformly low population growth, labor flows across the Rio Grande are projected to slow markedly. Europe, in contrast, will face substantial demographically driven migration pressures from across the Mediterranean for decades to come. Although these projected inflows would triple the first-generation immigrant stocks of larger European countries between 2010 and 2040, they would still absorb only a small fraction of the 800-million-person increase in the working-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa that is projected to occur over this period.},

	volume = {160},
	abstract = {Research on the political economy of immigration overlooks the specificity of human capital in skilled occupations and its implications for immigration preferences and policymaking. Conclusions that skilled Americans are unconcerned about labor market competition from skilled migrants build on a simple dichotomy between high and low skill migrants. In this article we show that natives turn to occupational licensing regulations as occupation-specific protectionist barriers to skilled migrant labor competition. In practice, high skill natives face labor market competition only from those high-skill migrants who share their occupation-specific skills. Licensure regulations ostensibly serve the public interest by certifying competence, but they can simultaneously be formidable barriers to entry by skilled migrants. From a collective action perspective, skilled natives can more easily secure sub-national, occupation-specific policies than influence national immigration policy. We exploit the unique structure of the American medical profession that allows us to distinguish between public interest and protectionist motives for migrant physician licensure regulations. We show that over the 1973–2010 period states with greater physician control over licensure requirements imposed more stringent requirements for migrant physician licensure and, as a consequence, received fewer new migrant physicians. By our estimates over a third of all US states could reduce their physician shortages by at least 10 percent within 5 years just by equalizing migrant and native licensure requirements. This article advances research on the political economy of immigration and highlights an overlooked dimension of international economic integration: regulatory rent-seeking as a barrier to the cross-national mobility of human capital, and the public policy implications of such barriers.},

They find, even after controlling for a variety of economic, social, policy, and international variables, that variation in political environments across time and destination plays a key role in observed patterns of international migration.},

Over the past two decades, migrant remittances have emerged as a significant source of external finance for developing countries, often exceeding conventional sources of capital such as foreign direct investment and bank lending. Remittances are unlike nearly all other capital flows in that they are stable and move countercyclically relative to the recipient country's economy. As a result, they mitigate the costs of forgone domestic monetary policy autonomy and also serve as an international risk-sharing mechanism for developing countries. The observable implication of these arguments is that remittances increase the likelihood that policy makers adopt fixed exchange rates. An analysis of data on de facto exchange rate regimes and a newly available data set on remittances for up to 74 developing countries from 1982 to 2006 provides strong support for these arguments. The results are robust to instrumental variable analysis and the inclusion of multiple economic and political variables.},

Beneath the “proletariat” now stands the “precariat,” for whom exploitation seems like a privilege compared to constant exclusion from the labor market.

Strikes in some foreign-invested factories have inspired claims of rising working-class power.

In this review, we focus on the two key processes of commodification and casualization and their implications for workers. On the one hand, these processes have resulted in the destruction of the old social contract and the emergence of marketized employment relations. This has implied a loss of the job security and generous benefits enjoyed by workers in the planned economy. On the other hand, commodification and casualization have produced significant but localized resistance from the Chinese working class. Up until now, the activities of labour non-governmental organizations and of the official trade unions have contributed to the state's effort of individualizing and institutionalizing labour conflict resolution through labour law and arbitration mechanisms. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the impact of 2008's Labour Contract Law and the outbreak of the economic crisis on labour relations. We conclude that the continual imbalance of power at the point of production presents a real dilemma for the Chinese state as it attempts to shift away from a model of development dependent on exports.},

	abstract = {The economic boom of the 1990s veiled a grim reality: in addition to the growing gap between rich and poor, the gap between good and bad quality jobs was also expanding. The postwar prosperity of the mid-twentieth century had enabled millions of American workers to join the middle class, but as this book shows, by the 1970s this upward movement had slowed, in part due to the steady disappearance of secure, well-paying industrial jobs. Ever since, precarious employment has been on the rise—paying low wages, offering few benefits, and with virtually no long-term security. Today, the polarization between workers with higher skill levels and those with low skills and low wages is more entrenched than ever. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs traces this trend to large-scale transformations in the American labor market and the changing demographics of low-wage workers. It draws on nearly four decades of survey data, as well as his own research, to evaluate trends in U.S. job quality and suggest ways to improve American labor market practices and social policies. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs provides an analysis of how and why precarious employment is gaining ground in the labor market and the role these developments have played in the decline of the middle class. It shows that by the 1970s, government deregulation, global competition, and the rise of the service sector gained traction, while institutional protections for workers—such as unions and minimum-wage legislation—weakened. Together, these forces marked the end of postwar security for American workers. The composition of the labor force also changed significantly; the number of dual-earner families increased, as did the share of the workforce comprised of women, non-white, and immigrant workers. Of these groups, blacks, Latinos, and immigrants remain concentrated in the most precarious and low-quality jobs, with educational attainment being the leading indicator of who will earn the highest wages and experience the most job security and highest levels of autonomy and control over their jobs and schedules. The book demonstrates, however, that building a better safety net—increasing government responsibility for worker health care and retirement, as well as strengthening unions—can go a long way toward redressing the effects of today's volatile labor market. There is every reason to expect that the growth of precarious jobs—which already make up a significant share of the American job market—will continue. Good Jobs, Bad Jobs shows that the decline in U.S. job quality is not the result of fluctuations in the business cycle, but rather the result of economic restructuring and the disappearance of institutional protections for workers. Only government, employers and labor working together on long-term strategies—including an expanded safety net, strengthened legal protections, and better training opportunities—can help reverse this trend.},

If once there was a substantial band of middle-class jobs with middling amounts of autonomy or authority, now that middle class has withered away and U.S. workers either have good jobs with much control over the work situation or bad jobs with virtually none. At the same time, Kalleberg shows that the mean level of many noneconomic rewards has increased over time, although job security has decreased and is accordingly an important exception to this overall upgrading trend. These claims and a host of related ones are ably presented with trend data from the usual national labor market surveys, the General Social Survey, the Quality of Employment Survey, and much more.”},

Among major foreign investors in Africa, China has stirred the most fear, hope, and controversy. For many, the specter of a Chinese neocolonial scramble is looming, while for others China is Africa's best chance at economic renewal. Yet, global debates about China in Africa have been based more on rhetoric than on empirical evidence. Ching Kwan Lee's The Specter of Global China is the first comparative ethnographic study that addresses the critical question: Is Chinese capital a different kind of capital? Offering the clearest look yet at China's state-driven investment in Africa, this book is rooted in six years of extensive fieldwork in copper mines and construction sites in Zambia, Africa's copper giant. Lee shadowed Chinese, Indian, and South African managers in underground mines, interviewed Zambian miners and construction workers, and worked with Zambian officials. Distinguishing carefully between Chinese state capital and global private capital in terms of their business objectives, labor practices, managerial ethos, and political engagement with the Zambian state and society, she concludes that Chinese state investment presents unique potential and perils for African development.

Today the organization of the global economy is entering another phase, with transformations that are reshaping the governance structures of both GVCs and global capitalism at various levels: (1) the end of the Washington Consensus and the rise of contending centers of economic and political power; (2) a combination of geographic consolidation and value chain concentration in the global supply base, which, in some cases, is shifting bargaining power from lead firms in GVCs to large suppliers in developing economies; (3) new patterns of strategic coordination among value chain actors; (4) a shift in the end markets of many GVCs accelerated by the economic crisis of 2008–09, which is redefining regional geographies of investment and trade; and (5) a diffusion of the GVC approach to major international donor agencies, which is prompting a reformulation of established development paradigms.},

While a government status constrains union bureaucracies' autonomy, it also paradoxically accounts for their influence in areas in which their active role is permitted and expected by the government. However, workplace unions' subordination to management leaves them no power whatsoever. Union bureaucracies' governmental status prevents them from operating through mobilizing grassroots labor support or exerting their influence by empowering their grassroots branches.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in underground labor organizations in China, this article theorizes a tactical innovation—disguised collective action—that lowers the cost of organizing contention under repression. Instead of forming organizations to facilitate collective action, organizations enable citizens to better contend as individuals. Departing from processes captured by the “dynamics of contention” framework, organizations act as unconventional mobilizing structures by coaching aggrieved citizens to make individual rights claims without engaging in perilous collective protests. Through a hidden pedagogical process, claimants are coached to deploy a repertoire of atomized actions that targets the bureaucratic mandate to maintain social stability and also appeals to officials' moral authority. When effective, disguised collective action can secure concessions for participants while allowing activists to strike a middle ground between challenging authorities and organizational survival.

Recent research has called this assumption into question by suggesting that voters do not have economically self-interested preferences about trade policy. We investigate one potential explanation for this puzzling finding: economic ignorance. We show that most voters do not understand the economic consequences of protectionism. We then use experiments to study how voters would respond if they had more information about how trade barriers affect the distribution of income. We find that distributional cues generate two opposing effects: they make people more likely to express self-serving policy preferences, but they also make people more sensitive to the interests of others. In our study both reactions were evident, but selfish responses outweighed altruistic ones. Thus, if people knew more about the distributional effects of trade, the correlation between personal interests and policy preferences would tighten. By showing how the explanatory power of economic self-interest depends on beliefs about causality, this research provides a foundation for more realistic, behaviorally informed theories of international political economy.},

The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress – by our lights – is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions.

In contrast, the effect on voting behavior is more limited in magnitude and its manifestations less understood. Negative economic shocks tend to increase support for more expansive social policy and for redistribution, strengthening the appeal of the left.

Several prominent studies have examined survey data on voters and concluded that fears about the negative effects of immigration on wages and employment play a major role generating anti-immigrant attitudes. We examine new data from a targeted survey of U.S. employees in 12 different industries. In contrast with previous studies, the findings indicate that fears about labor market competition do not appear to have substantial effects on attitudes toward immigration, and preferences with regard to immigration policy, among this large and diverse set of voters},

The essay also provides a sympathetic critique of OEP and shows how the paradigm can be extended to capture some of the concerns and insights of other critics. Most important, this critique highlights the role and consequences of certain simplifying assumptions commonly used in OEP and calls for a closer examination of how international institutions and policies structure and change the interests of actors within countries that are now taken as exogenous.},

	abstract = {The recent backlash against globalization in many advanced economies raises questions about the source of this protectionist sentiment. Traditional accounts generally attribute the welfare consequences of trade to skill level or industry characteristics, or instead emphasize the nonmaterial determinants of support for openness. Consequently, we know little about how a major labor market characteristic—occupation—shapes both the distributional consequences of and preferences toward trade openness. We propose and test a new theory of trade policy preferences based on occupation characteristics. Drawing from the tasks literature in economics, we argue that occupation characteristics are a key determinant of how trade affects workers and thus individuals' trade preferences. Our theory suggests that, in advanced economies, individuals in routine-task-intensive occupations will be negatively affected by trade, and thus more protectionist. This relationship will increase in the degree to which occupation job tasks can be provided from a distance (i.e., offshorable). We find support for our theory using data from the 2003 and 2013 International Social Survey Programme in high-income democracies. Our results suggest that the occupational characteristics of routineness and offshorability are important determinants of trade preferences, offering additional understanding of the sources of protectionist sentiment even after controlling for labor market characteristics suggested by conventional wisdom.},

Unless a person, company, or end consumer is valuing the person who is contributing to the production of information or services in that moment, it can quickly slide into ghost work conditions. Systems that depend on data to map out decision trees for computational processes rely on people to label the training data—fixing typos and broken hyperlinks, adding descriptive tags, removing accidental characters, etc. People make this data legible to software. Computer scientists developing algorithms need people to improve the “guesses” that AI makes about things, such as whether an image is a dog or cat or whether an email is spam.

Despite the availability of product-level trade data, most researchers rely on either the total volume of trade or certain sets of aggregated products. In this paper, we develop a new dynamic clustering method to effectively summarize this massive amount of product-level information. The proposed method classifies a set of dyads into several clusters based on their similarities in trade profile — the product composition of imports and exports — and captures the evolution of the resulting clusters over time. We apply this method to two billion observations of product-level annual trade flows. We show how typical dyadic trade relationships evolve from sparse trade to inter-industry trade and then to intra-industry trade.

	annote = {I argue that the increased ability of firms to produce anywhere in the world combined with growing international competition due to lowered trade barriers has led to greater limits on immigration. I argue that businesses relying on low-skill labor have been the major proponents of greater openness to immigrants. Immigration helps lower costs, making these businesses more competitive at home and abroad. However, increased international competition, due to lower trade barriers and greater economic development in the developing world, has led many businesses in wealthy countries to close or move overseas. Productivity increases have allowed those firms that have chosen to remain behind to do more with fewer workers. Together, these changes in the international economy have sapped the crucial business support necessary for more open immigration policies at home, empowered anti-immigrant groups, and spurred greater controls on migration. Increased openness to trade affects businesses that use low-skilled labor, in particular, as these firms are the most vulnerable to competition from overseas. It may also be beginning to affect high-skilled U.S. companies that face increasing competition from the developing world. When U.S. businesses close or move overseas, they are less inclined to support open immigration, giving anti-immigrant groups more leverage in policy discussions. The result is a more restrictive immigration policy, trade barriers in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to much greater openness for immigrant than we see today. Back then, almost everyone who wanted to come to the U.S. could legally immigrate. Businesses were protected by high tariffs but had to pay high wages. Open immigration kept U.S. wages from rising to the point that the tariffs would have been ineffective. Once these barriers began to be removed after World War II, business support for immigration declined precipitously. After examining the Congressional Record, I found that in the 1950s more than eight businesses on average testified at congressional hearings on immigration. Today, that number has dropped to two. The decline has been even steeper for industries that have been exposed to increased trade; today, perhaps just one company that produces goods that can be traded will testify at these congressional hearings. While many businesses continue to support immigration, especially agriculture and service industries such as hotels and restaurants, open trade has effectively shrunk the business coalition for immigration. With the loss of business support, immigration has become increasingly restricted, especially for immigrants with the fewest skills. Peters assembles an impressive dataset on immigration and trade policy around the world — nineteen countries, some OECD members, some Gulf Arab and East Asian countries — over two centuries to test her argument. She starts by describing trade and immigration policy across this sample, referring along the way to changes in transportation that have lowered the costs of international trade. Peters shows that for this international sample, trade and immigration policy are negatively correlated: that as countries liberalise trade, they restrict immigration.},

These models are useful and easily interpreted, and the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of these models are well studied and understood. Regression models applied to spatial data frequently contain spatially autocorrelated residuals, however, indicating a misspecification error. This problem is limited to spatial data (although similar problems occur with time series data), so it has received less attention than more frequently encountered problems. A method called spatial filtering with eigenvectors has been proposed to account for this problem. We apply this method to ten real-world data sets and a series of simulated data sets to begin to understand the conditions under which the method can be most usefully applied. We find that spatial filtering with eigenvectors reduces spatial misspecification errors, increases the strength of the model fit, frequently increases the normality of model residuals, and can increase the homoscedasticity of model residuals. We provide a sample script showing how to apply the method in the R statistical environment. Spatial filtering with eigenvectors is a powerful geographic method that should be applied to many regression models that use geographic data.},

For a discussion see this post by Andrew Gelman and follow up comments by Winston Lin (that led us to the Allison reference we use below) and by Jens Hainmueller (that describes this logic). In this post, design diagnosis shows that which approach is best depends on how outcomes are generated in the first place.

This paper interprets them instead as statistical tests for a null of fairness within well‐defined income generating processes. We find that the likelihood ratio(LR) test for fairness versus unfairness within two such processes are proportional to Theil's first and second inequality indices respectively. The LR values may either be used as a test statistic or to approximate a Bayes factor that measures the posterior probabilities of the fair version of the processes over that of the unfair.

In particular, we motivate the use of Theilís two canonical indices of inequality, including the increasingly well used Mean Log Deviation measure, as tests of a null of a "fair" income process versus an alternative of an unfair one in the same class.” “Friedmanís example, it will be recalled, is one where a single lottery is faced by all individuals, but because of the luck of the draw, there is inequality in the observed distribution. Thus all individuals facing the same lottery is a sharp characterization of ìfairness.” “We introduce two income distribution processes which will frame our discussion and analysis of testing for fairness.

In the first case the helicopter hovering over the population drops dollars which attach to individuals at random. In the second case there is initially a uniform áow of dollars to individuals on the ground before the helicopter comes on to the scene. What the helicopter does is to drop stops to this flow, stops which attach to individuals at random. We refer to the two processes above as “The Helicopter Money Drop” and “The Helicopter Money Stop” respectively” Helicopter drop: “We envisage a helicopter dropping Y units of currency onto a population. The null is that the probability of each person receiving an income unit is equal and the alternative is that these probabilities are unequal.” PDF of observed incomes in multinomial with common p under the null.

Most importantly, the U- index is an ordinal measure at the level of feelings.” Cortisol = stress hormone. “Survey Techniques for Collecting Data on Evaluated Time Use Experience Sample Method (ESM) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). ESM and EMA are techniques for collecting data on time use and emotional experiences in real time. Respondents typically carry a computer device (a Personal Digital Assistant, called a PDA, for example) and indicate features of their activity and the feelings prior to being signaled by the device. EMA studies typically collect environmental information as well and may include physiological measurements (e.g., blood pressure, cortisol). Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). DRM is a paper- and- pencil questionnaire that fi rst collects time diary information from individuals for the preceding day. The diaries can list personal details, as they are not collected. Then, for each indicated episode, individuals indicate the nature of the activity, who was present, and the extent to which various emotions were present or absent. Princeton Affect and Time Survey (PATS). PATS is a telephone survey patterned after the American Time Use Survey. After individuals report the activities of the preceding day (who with, what doing, where, when started and ended), three fi fteen- minute intervals are randomly sampled and respondents are asked the extent to which various emotions were present or absent during that time” “Momentary real- time surveys are often viewed as the gold standard for collecting data on affective experience because it minimizes effects of judgment and of memory. As a convention, we will refer to studies that collect data on emotions in real time as ESM studies throughout the remainder of the chapter{\textbackslash}ldotsAn alternative to ESM that relies on a short recall period is the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), which is described in Kahneman et al. (2004). The DRM combines elements of experience sampling and time diaries, and is designed specifi cally to facilitate accurate emotional recall” DRM: “Respondents—who participated in the survey in a central location—were provided with four packets containing separate questionnaires, and were asked to answer them in sequence. The fi rst packet had standard questions on life, health, and work satisfaction and demographics. Satisfaction questions were asked fi rst so that answers were not contaminated by the other questions and diary that followed. Second, respondents fi lled out a time diary summarizing episodes that occurred in the preceding day. The third packet asked respondents to describe each episode of the day by indicating the following: when the episode began and ended, what they were doing (by selecting activities from a provided list), where they were, and with whom they were interacting. To ascertain how they felt during each episode in regards to selected affective dimensions, respondents were also asked to report the intensity of their feelings along twelve categories on a scale from zero (“Not at all”) to six (“Very Much”). The affective categories were specifi ed by descriptors, mostly adjectives, such as happy, worried/ anxious, and angry/ hostile. The anchor, “Not at all,” is intended to be a natural zero point that has a common meaning across respondents for these descriptors. The fi nal packet contained personality and work questions. Subjects were paid \$75 for fi lling out the DRM questionnaire, which usually took forty- fi ve to seventy- fi ve minutes to complete” Shows that DRM does a reasonbly good job of reproducing ESM measurement wrt emotions. PATS is ok wrt to DRM. “Alan Krueger and Arthur Stone have conducted a small scale study of 168 workers in Syracuse, NY and Stony Brook, NY who participated in a specially designed ESM study on three consecutive days in the spring and summer of 2008 (on a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). A day later, participants also completed the PATS questionnaire referring to the same days covered by the ESM survey. In the ESM component of the survey, respondents were asked about their feelings on six occasions on each day, after being prompted by a PDA. The PATS component asked about emotions during three randomly selected fi fteen- minute intervals. Because it proved impossible to conduct the study on a representative sample, subjects were recruited through advertising and were offered \$120 for their participation.” Correlation between PATS and ESM U-index “lower than one might hope” “We conclude that the PATS instrument and real- time reporting do a reasonably similar job characterizing individuals or activities. They are less consistent in describing feelings at specifi c moments, although the measures are still positively correlated and the mean reported emotion over all moments is remarkably similar regardless of whether it is reported in real- time or recalled a day later” (44) Calculate U-index by activity type using standardized activities from ATUS. Then performed k-means on activities and then group together and track. “Another issue concerns the context of time use. That is, the precise situations that people are engaged in during their daily activities. Available time- use surveys collect only coarse information on the nature of activities..important features of activities are not measured by time- use surveys{\textbackslash}ldotsA related issue is that the nature of some activities changes over time.” (79)},

When {\textbackslash}lambda {\textgreater} 0, the model can be regarded as incorporating an element of fairness, not in the sense that players have a particular target they consider “fair,” but in the sense that they are willing to be more altruistic to an opponent who is more altruistic toward them. One of our major conclusions is that {\textbackslash}lambda = 0 is not consistent with data from the ultimatum game. Obviously the coefficient a\_i is not independent of the units in which utility is measured, and utility must be measured in the “same” interpersonally comparable units for all players. The linearity of payoffs in opponents' utility may be taken as a convenient approximation.” 597-98 All based on “sequential equilibirum” “The strategy of the specification we have chosen is to suppose that players do not care about whether their opponents play “fairly,” but rather whether their opponents are nice people.

Four player v. two? possible that “spite” here is actually competitiveness. The theory predicts that spiteful play should take place, even in a one-player setting. In other words, if a single player is given the option to deprive an opponent of money at a sufficiently modest cost to himself, then we should observe 20\% or more of players availing themselves of this option. Moreover, in two-move games such as the best-shot game discussed by Prasnikar and Roth, in which all first players are observed to play the same way, the second mover should exhibit the same degree of altruism or spite. when posed with the simple second-period decision problem with no first-player move. “spite involves explicit retaliation and not merely signaling.”},

The viability of such surveys is being challenged by declining response rates and related developments that affect not only the quantity but the quality of the information collected. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the leader among federal agencies in the breadth and volume of the household surveys it sponsors. Recognizing the challenges facing departmental surveys, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is convening a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) on March 18, 2016, to examine the scope of the problem, discuss what the survey sponsors have found to be the most effective approaches to maintaining robust response rates and achieving representativeness in their surveys, and consider future steps. This document was prepared to provide critical background for the TEP meeting. It reviews recent assessments of trends in response rates among primarily federal surveys and the reasons for declining response rates; documents response trends in the major HHS surveys from the mid1990s through the most recent year available; examines what is known about the relationship between response rates and nonresponse bias; reviews approaches to addressing nonresponse and its effects; and summarizes key conclusions. A recent report by the Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Sciences documented declines in response rates to household surveys since the late 1990s. Declines were not universal, and some surveys experienced greater declines than others, but the phenomenon of declining responses is sufficiently widespread that it has generated growing concerns about the potential for nonresponse bias. While this review focuses on unit nonresponse, nonresponse to individual survey questions is a concern as well. Trends in item nonresponse are not nearly as well documented as trends in unit nonresponse, but it is readily apparent that item nonresponse among those who respond to surveys is increasing as unit response rates decline. A common way of classifying the many reasons for nonresponse to a survey uses three categories: (1) non-contact, (2) refusal, or (3) other. The “other” category encompasses such reasons as language issues, poor health, and absence from home during the data collection period. Multiple societal and environmental factors have been suggested as contributing to the decline in survey response rates, either by making it more difficult to contact prospective respondents or by increasing the likelihood that, if contacted, they will refuse to participate. When non-interviews are apportioned among non-contacts, refusals, and other reasons, there is evidence that the distribution among these factors has changed little with growing nonresponse. In general, the increase in nonresponse has been much greater in telephone surveys than in face-to-face surveys, which is consistent with the growing number of solicitations that households receive by telephone and the increasing use of answering machines and caller ID to screen calls. The observation that noncontacts do not appear to have grown as a share of nonresponse has led some researchers to suggest that the impact of technological barriers may be},

	title = {Nonresponse in {Social} {Science} {Surveys}: {A} {Research} {Agenda}.},
	abstract = {For many household surveys in the United States, responses rates have been steadily declining for at least the past two decades. A similar decline in survey response can be observed in all wealthy countries. Efforts to raise response rates have used such strategies as monetary incentives or repeated attempts to contact sample members and obtain completed interviews, but these strategies increase the costs of surveys. This review addresses the core issues regarding survey nonresponse. It considers why response rates are declining and what that means for the accuracy of survey results. These trends are of particular concern for the social science community, which is heavily invested in obtaining information from household surveys. The evidence to date makes it apparent that current trends in nonresponse, if not arrested, threaten to undermine the potential of household surveys to elicit information that assists in understanding social and economic issues. The trends also threaten to weaken the validity of inferences drawn from estimates based on those surveys. High nonresponse rates create the potential or risk for bias in estimates and affect survey design, data collection, estimation, and analysis. The survey community is painfully aware of these trends and has responded aggressively to these threats. The interview modes employed by surveys in the public and private sectors have proliferated as new technologies and methods have emerged and matured. To the traditional trio of mail, telephone, and face-to-face surveys have been added interactive voice response (IVR), audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI), web surveys, and a number of hybrid methods. Similarly, a growing research agenda has emerged in the past decade or so focused on seeking solutions to various aspects of the problem of survey nonresponse; the potential solutions that have been considered range from better training and deployment of interviewers to more use of incentives, better use of the information collected in the data collection, and increased use of auxiliary information from other sources in survey design and data collection. Nonresponse in Social Science Surveys: A Research Agenda also documents the increased use of information collected in the survey process in nonresponse adjustment.},

@techreport{harris_proposal_2015,
	title = {A {Proposal} for {Modernizing} {Labor} {Laws} for {Twenty}-{First}-{Century} {Work}: {The} “{Independent} {Worker}”},
	abstract = {New and emerging work relationships arising in the “online gig economy” do not fit easily into the existing legal definitions of “employee” and “independent contractor” status. The distinction is important because employees qualify for a range of legally mandated benefits and protections that are not available to independent contractors, such as the right to organize and bargain collectively, workers' compensation insurance coverage, and overtime compensation. This paper proposes a new legal category, which we call “independent workers,” for those who occupy the gray area between employees and independent contractors. Independent workers typically work with intermediaries who match workers to customers. The independent worker and the intermediary have some elements of the arms-length independent business relationships that characterize “independent contractor” status, and some elements of a traditional employee-employer relationship. On the one hand, independent workers have the ability to choose when to work, and whether to work at all. They may work with multiple intermediaries simultaneously, or conduct personal tasks while they are working with an intermediary. It is thus impossible in many circumstances to attribute independent workers' work hours to any employer. In this critical respect, independent workers are similar to independent businesses. On the other hand, the intermediary retains some control over the way independent workers perform their work, such as by setting their fees or fee caps, and they may “fire” workers by prohibiting them from using their service. In these respects, independent workers are similar to traditional employees. Evidence is presented suggesting that about 600,000 workers, or 0.4 percent of total U.S. employment, work with an online intermediary in the gig economy. Although there are probably many more workers who currently work with an offline intermediary who would qualify for independent worker status than there are who work with an online intermediary, the number of workers participating in the online gig economy is growing very rapidly. In our proposal, independent workers — regardless of whether they work through an online or offline intermediary — would qualify for many, although not all, of the benefits and protections that employees receive, including the freedom to organize and collectively bargain, civil rights protections, tax withholding, and employer contributions for payroll taxes. Because it is conceptually impossible to attribute their work hours to any single intermediary, however, independent workers would not qualify for hours-based benefits, including overtime or minimum wage requirements. Further, because independent workers would rarely, if ever, qualify for unemployment insurance benefits given the discretion they have to choose whether to work through an intermediary, they would not be covered by the program or be required to contribute taxes to fund that program. However, intermediaries would be permitted to pool independent workers for purposes of purchasing and providing insurance and other benefits at lower cost and higher quality without the risk that their relationship will be transformed into an employment relationship. Our proposal seeks to structure benefits to make independent worker status neutral when compared with employee status, as well as to enhance the efficiency of the operation of the labor market. By extending many of the legal benefits and protections found in employment relationships to independent workers, our proposal would protect and extend the social compact between workers and employers, and reduce the legal uncertainty and legal costs that currently beset many independent worker relationships.},

We find that the probability of choosing the lottery is uniform across the distribution except for the last-place player, who chooses the lottery significantly more often. In the second set of experiments, participants play modified dictator games. Individuals are randomly assigned a unique dollar amount, with each player separated by a single dollar, and then shown the resulting distribution. They are then given an additional \$2, which they must give to the person either directly above or below them in the distribution. Giving the \$2 to the person below means that the individual herself will fall in rank, as ranks are separated by \$1. Nonetheless, players almost always choose to give the money to the person below them, consistent with Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and other work on inequality aversion. However, the subject in second-to-last place gives the money to the person above her between one-half and one-fourth of the time, consistent with LPA's prediction that concern about relative status will be greatest for individuals who are at risk of falling into last place. “we can always separate last-place or low-rank aversion from a desire to be above the median, the inequality-aversion model of Fehr and Schmidt (1999), the equity-reciprocity-competition model of Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), the distributional preference model of Charness and Rabin (2002), total-surplus maximization, and, generally, a linear effect of initial rank.” “If, instead, individuals create reference groups specific to whatever policy question they are considering, then LPA has more hope of explaining policy preferences." Note that relatively few studies have dictator games with n{\textgreater}2 Game 1: groups of 6, with groups being fixed across all rounds. Each round begins with the computer randomly assigning each player a place in the distribution \$1.75, \$2.00, \$2.25, \$2.50, \$2.75, \$3.00. Ranks and actual dollar amounts of all players are common knowledge and clearly displayed throughout the game. The computer then presents an identical two-option choice set to all players in the game: In this round, which would you prefer? (i) Win \$0.13 with 100\% probability. (ii) Win \$0.50 with 75\% probability and lose \$1.00 with 25\% probability. After players have submitted their choices, the computer makes independent draws from the common PðwinÞ ¼ 3=4 probability distribution for each player who chooses the lottery and adds the riskfree amount to the balance of each player who did not choose the lottery. The new balances and ranks are then displayed. The players are then re-randomized to the same \$1.75, . . ., \$3.00 distribution and the game repeats. Each session consists of nine rounds, To solve for expectations, make assumptions about strategic abilities of subjects: “assume that, as a heuristic, players hold others' balances constant when they make their decisions.11 LPA then predicts that the last-place player will choose the lottery more often than other players will.” “Second, assume that instead of holding others' balances constant, individuals assume that their fellow subjects choose randomly between the lottery and risk-free option (that is, they assume their fellow players are level-0 reasoners{\textbackslash}ldots” “Finally, players may assume their opponents play strategically and thus solve for the Nash equilibrium” NE in mixed strategies. Results are interesting but not that strong{\textbackslash}ldotsbut “The only significant differential LPA effect we find is that men are more likely than women to choose the lottery when in last place” “the heightened tendency of the lastplace player to choose the lottery is not merely an artifact of rerandomization and remains when balances accumulate. In this case, we find evidence that the second-to-last-place player chooses the lottery at a significantly higher rate as well. In fact, he is marginally more likely to choose the lottery than the lastplace player, though this difference is reduced when we drop the first two rounds and disappears when we control for whether losing the lottery would lead to a negative balance” Game 2: As in the lottery experiment, the game begins with players (N= 42, divided into seven six-player games) being randomly assigned dollar amounts, in this case \$1, \$2, . . . , \$6. As before, the ranks and current balances of all players are common knowledge throughout the game. Each player ranked two through five must choose between giving the player directly above or directly below them an additional \$2. As players are separated by \$1, giving to the player below results in a drop in rank. “After players make their decisions, one player is randomly chosen and his choice determines the final payoffs of that round. As such, players should make their decisions as if they alone will determine the final distribution of the round. To avoid any reciprocity effects, players do not know which player is chosen or the outcome of the round. After the end of each round, players are rerandomized across the same \$1, \$2, . . . , \$6 distribution and the game repeats. They are paid their final balances for one randomly chosen round.” Also do sessions with 8 players. no difference. Quite large proportions of players give to lower ranked pair (upwards of 80\%)},

They had to choose how much of the 100 doblons to bet (ie, a number between 0 and 100). The doblons cumulated visibly on their screen if they were not spent. The computer then randomly generated a number between 1 and 3. If a 1 was drawn, subjects kept the original amount and gained twice the amount they had bet. If a 2 or 3 was drawn, the person lost the amount he or she had bet. The betting stage was identical to the practice stage except for two things: 1) the scores of all players (labelled as 1, 2, 3 and, if any, 4) were displayed on each screen and updated at the end of each of the ten rounds; 2) there was an experimental manipulation affecting the way money was distributed. Subjects 1 and 2 received an advantage. They got (and could bet up to) 130 doblons each round rather than the 100 of the other players, and this was common knowledge ayers 1 and 2 were given an additional gift of 500 doblons at the start of the following stage “Type distribution”: Schmidt's [1999]. H2 (Type distributions). It is quite possible that people have different inter dependent preferences: perhaps, say, some people are envious, others are altruistic and still others self-interested. We shall consider three recently proposed type distributions: Offerman et al.'s [1996], Levine's [1998] and Andreoni and Miller's (forthcoming). According to Offerman et al. 's distri bution, we should expect no more than 7\% of the people to burn; according to the Andreoni and Miller model, no more than 34.5\%. This bound is basically non-existent for the (rather nasty) Levine's type distribution, where as much as 86\% of the subjects could burn. “each subject had an average 48.7\% of her earnings burnt. Further, a majority of the subjects (62.5\%) chose to burn” “A more fundamental anomaly in our data is that desert matters” “or concern for fairness. The details are more complicated. We have to qualify the broad affirmative answer by recognizing one limitation of the study. Our measurement of the price elasticity of burning - and our interpretation of burning activity more generally - faces an objection. Subjects had to burn conditional on the expec tations of burning by the other players” Burning does not decline much with price. It starts to do so noticeably only when a price of 0.25 is reached (meaning I have to give up 25 cents to burn one dollar of your money hold ings). There is a strong correlation between wealth, or rank, and the amounts by which subjects are burnt: most subjects - especially disadvantaged ones (ie9 those who do not receive "gifts") - burn the wealthiest among the other players disadvantaged subjects care only about whether money has been received deserved ly or otherwise. They appear to use this fact in deciding whether to burn Ideas: Remove strategic incentives about expectations. Remove public info about who is advantaged.

This study introduces a self-report Spitefulness Scale to assess individual differences in spitefulness. The scale was initially tested on a large sample of 946 college students and cross-validated on a national sample of 297 adults. The scale was internally consistent in both samples. Factor analysis supported a 1-factor solution for the initial pool of 31 items. Item response theory analysis was used to identify the best performing of the original 31 items in the university sample and reduce the scale to 17 items. Tests of measurement invariance indicated that the items functioned similarly across both university and national samples, across both men and women, and across both ethnic majority and minority groups. Men reported higher levels of spitefulness than women, younger people were more spiteful than older people, and ethnic minority members reported higher levels of spitefulness than ethnic majority members. Across both samples, spitefulness was positively associated with aggression, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and guilt-free shame, and negatively correlated with selfesteem, guilt-proneness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Ideally, this Spitefulness Scale will be able to predict behavior in both laboratory settings (e.g., ultimatum games, aggression paradigms) and everyday life, contribute to the diagnosis of personality disorders and oppositional defiant disorder, and encourage further study of this neglected, often destructive, trait.},

The end goal is the harm incurred by the target. There may be indirect benefits—otherwise the behaviour would not be functional—but these are less tangible than for functional punishment. Whereas functional punishment emphasizes the delayed benefits to the punisher, functional spite emphasizes the immediate costs to the target; negative consequences for the target are the raisons d'eˆtre for spiteful acts” “People appear to be vindictive, namely they are willing to pay a cost to inflict harm for the sake of having the proposer suffer a loss (Fehr \& Fischbacher 2005; Fehr et al. 2008)” “In other words, the intuitive interpretation may not be correct. The harm inflicted, if it is not intended to change the target's behaviour, is not psychological punishment. If there is no ulterior motive, then the motive is psychological spite.” “While it is not possible to draw strong conclusions on social comparisons yet, it does seem that humans are much more spitefully motivated than are other animals. If this indeed is the case, the obvious question is, how can the most prosocial species on the planet also be the most antisocial?” “As a result, we flexibly adjust our cooperativeness and competitiveness to the size of the group; people will cooperate when competition is more global, compete when it is more local (West et al. 2006; see also Gardner \& West 2004a,b). It is hard to imagine another species in which individuals flexibly adjust their competition and cooperation depending on the size of the group and the presence of other groups, compete for the spirit of competition, gauge success in relative terms, savour the failure of others and use these negative social concerns to seek the downfall of rivals as seen in parochialism, tribalism, war and so on” “If functional spite lies on the path between second-party and third-party functional punishment, tracking its evolution will illuminate human hyper-competitiveness, and in turn suggest something about our hypercooperativeness.

Our results suggest that spitefulness diminishes the propensity to cooperate, even in those situations in which mutual cooperation is an equilibrium for selfish players. Finally, we find empirical patterns suggesting that the willingness to reduce another's material payoff— either for the sake of achieving more equality or for the sake of being ahead—is stronger among individuals belonging to high castes than among those belonging to low castes.” “A spiteful individual is willing to forgo material gains from trade unless the terms of trade give him a large share of the pie. A spiteful individual is also more likely to violate contracts—either by providing low effort or low quality or by a lower willingness to pay the bill—because such contract violations increase the shirker's payoff at the expense of the trading partner.” “ring test” (??)

If B does so, he reduces the total payoff and violates the equality norm. Forty-two percent of the high-caste members but only 21 percent of the low-caste members behave in this spiteful way—a difference that is significant. In game 4, player B has again a similar option, but this time behaving spitefully is costly for B. Here, we see no difference between the two castes, but it is still striking that roughly one-third of the players in both castes prefers the spiteful allocation.” To summarize, these results show that, on average, high-caste subjects value others' payoff strongly negatively if they experience disadvantageous disutility, and in some circumstances (game 2), the prevalence of spiteful preferences is much larger among high-caste subjects Game N* Payoffs 1 rupees for other, rupees for self2 for left option and right option Fraction who choose left option p-value High caste Low caste Two-sided One-sided 1 60 B chooses 190, 902 vs. 170, 1002 0.40 0.47 0.609 2 76 B chooses 170, 902 vs. 190, 902 0.42 0.21 0.049 0.024 3 90 B chooses 1100, 1002 vs. 1180, 1102 0.44 0.29 0.128 0.064 4 60 B chooses 1100, 1502 vs. 1160, 1602 0.30 0.33 0.785 0.40 5 60 B chooses 1160, 1002 vs. 1110, 1102 0.53 0.53 1.00 6 74 B chooses 1150, 1202 vs. 1100, 1302 0.46 0.62 0.166 7 60 B chooses 1150, 1502 vs. 1100, 1602 0.83 0.53 0.01 Notes: Bold numbers indicate the dictator's payoff.

Based on the results of the previous section, the null hypothesis for games 2 to 4 is that high castes are more spiteful or more willing to pay to reduce disadvantageous inequality; therefore, we added one-sided p-values for these games.},

Subjects also significantly increased their Pareto-damaging behavior following selfish actions by A.” “Our regression analysis indicates that a B who has a higher payoff than A puts great weight on A's payoff.

When A has mistreated B, B significantly decreases positive weight or puts negative weight on A's payoff.” Letting {\textbackslash}pi\_A and {\textbackslash}pi\_B be Player A's and B's money payoffs, consider the following simple formulation of Player B's preferences: U\_B({\textbackslash}pi\_A, {\textbackslash}pi\_B) = ({\textbackslash}rho * r + {\textbackslash}sigma *s + þeta * q) {\textbackslash}pi\_A +(1- {\textbackslash}rho * r - {\textbackslash}sigma *s - þeta * q) {\textbackslash}pi\_B, where r = 1 if {\textbackslash}pi\_B {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}pi\_A, and r = 0 otherwise; s = 1 if {\textbackslash}pi\_B {\textless} {\textbackslash}pi\_A , and s = 0 otherwise; q = — 1 if A has misbehaved, and q = 0 otherwise þeta is reciprocity parameter {\textbackslash}rho \& {\textbackslash}sigma are distributional preferences parameters {\textbackslash}rho turns out to be important, {\textbackslash}sigma not so much. “Overall, the major gains in explanatory power come from allowing {\textbackslash}rho to vary independently of {\textbackslash}sigma” competitive preferences: assuming that {\textbackslash}sigma {\textless} {\textbackslash}rho {\textless} 0, meaning that Player B always prefers to do as well as possible in comparison to A, while also caring directly about her payoff.

Discrepancy between what we want to assess and what we actuall do assess using a particular statistical analysis. discrepency between P(Y {\textbar} X) and P(Y {\textbar} do(X)) To deconfound two variables we need to block/close every noncausal pathway without blocking any casual pathways. back-door path: any path from X to Y that starts with arrows pointing in to X. X and Y deconfoudned if we block all back door paths.

Front door criterion Conjectures that DAGs are close to how human brain represents causality. Viewing causal inference and missing data is misleading; not intersted in the FPCI. Mediation fallacy: conditioning on the mediator instead of holding constant (harmless if there is no confoundingof mediator and outcome). Total effect = DE + IE doesn't work when there are interactions (moderation) or nonlinearities. So introduces “natural effect” Direct effect: let mediator value be fixed at it's value under no treatment for each individual. Wiggle treatment and see what happens. [Different from controlled direct effect in which mediator fixed at same value for every individual]. Natural indirect effect: deny treatment to everyone. Then let mediator choose value it would have been under treatment for each individual \& see what happens. “To me, a formula is a baked idea. Words are ideas in the oven.” (335) “It [a formula] is a social contract. It puts a frame around an idea and says “This is something I believe is important.

Together, these two equations imply that (3) the recurring, “flow”, payments to miners for running the blockchain must be large relative to the one-off, “stock”, benefits of attacking it. This is very expensive! The constraint is softer (i.e., stock versus stock) if both (i) the mining technology used to run the blockchain is both scarce and non-repurposable, and (ii) any majority attack is a “sabotage” in that it causes a collapse in the economic value of the blockchain; however, reliance on non-repurposable technology for security and vulnerability to sabotage each raise their own concerns, and point to specific collapse scenarios. In particular, the model suggests that Bitcoin would be majority attacked if it became sufficiently economically important — e.g., if it became a “store of value” akin to gold — which suggests that there are intrinsic economic limits to how economically important it can become in the first place.},

Equation (3) says that for the trust to be meaningful requires that the flow cost of running the blockchain is large relative to the one-shot value of attacking it. In the doublespending attack considered in Section 2.1, the implication is that the transaction costs of the blockchain must be large in relation to the largest-possible economic uses of the blockchain, which can be interpreted as a large implicit tax. The argument that an attack is actually more expensive 15 than this flow cost, considered in Section 3, requires one to concede both (i) that the security of the blockchain actually relies on its use of scarce, non-repurposable technology (counter to the Nakamoto (2008) vision of “one-CPU-one-vote”), and (ii) that the blockchain is vulnerable to sabotage, and at a cost that is linear in the amount of specialized computational equipment devoted to its maintenance.

That is, for any given, unconditional distribution of preferences, it is possible for the preferences among those voters who do turn out to have any (other) distribution 3) simple correlations between C, D, and preferences generate predictable skews in the turnout set and thus in the voting outcome. Fourth, as one increases the noisiness of this correlation, there is (speaking quite loosely now) a tendency in the limit for turnout to approach 50\% and for the distribution of preferences in the turnout set to become representative of the unconditional distribution of preferences in the population Taken together, these results support a broader proposition that, if representativeness is the concern (a normative question that we do not address), one should pay more attention to differential selection than to turnout levels “once even a modest portion of actual voters no longer behaves in a hyper-rational QV fashion (that is, as if under View I), then the remaining pure-QV'ers will find it in their interest to cast a negligible quantity of votes. Therefore, almost all votes cast as well as voting outcomes will be essentially unaffected by the hyperrational QV calculus; instead, social and psychological forces will dominate” QV mechanics: Optimal votes under QV, V* = PB/2. u\_piv is utility of pivotality. its (PB){\textasciicircum}2/4 Complexity of calculations involves determining pivotalty beliefs that are in equilibrium. QV headaches increase C (?) QV may decrease D, crowd out. “For example, if the applicable norm is egalitarian, the number of votes cast or expenditures may be independent of intensity, again generating a one person, one vote sort of outcome. But if the norm is that preference intensity should be expressed, we would have QV-like variation in the number of votes that individuals cast—driven not by the QV self-interested calculus (View I) but instead by social norms (View II).” “This creates a tension because one is voting in the first place as a consequence of having sublimated selfish concerns (Upiv - C) to social ones (D), but then one is spending money precisely to advance the selfish interests that cannot rationalize either showing up at all or spending more than, say, \$0.000025.” “Taken together, the complexity and queasiness of hyper-rational, pure-QV voting, along with the miniscule expenditure that such voting involves, might push nearly everyone to View II behavior—and, as we explained, even if only a modest fraction behaves according to View II, the preferences of remaining QV'ers are drowned out. And how would View II individuals actually vote under QV? Familiar behavioral considerations favor focal-point voting (such as 1 vote for \$1) or other highly simplified rubrics, and the social nature of voting (which centrally explains why voters turn out in the first place) would likely exert a significant influence on which focal points or what expenditure levels individuals would choose.” “Under one person, one vote, affinity groups manifest themselves in terms of turnout (by influencing D) and expressed preferences (which candidate or other outcome will be selected, conditional on voting). The mechanisms include volunteerism, contributions, discussions, and statements of recognized leaders. One supposes that these influences have a moderate effect, perhaps by moving turnout rates a few percentage points here and there (on a base of, say, 50\%)—generating some nonrepresentativeness of the turnout set—in addition to guiding how some voters cast their votes. Under QV, the same phenomena would be present, but they now will operate on an additional margin: how many votes individuals cast” “Individuals might, to a significant extent, treat a single election, despite the many contests on the ballot, as in one mental account. Perhaps they would allocate a budget—maybe \$10 or \$50—to the election as a whole.” “Another possibility is that such proposals would draw most of individuals' expenditures in order to ensure that none would pass, leaving little room for preference expression regarding the core questions on the ballot, perhaps generating peculiar outcomes if many otherwise have exhausted their budgets. Note further that these possibilities create substantial incentives for agenda manipulation (ballot cramming, in contrast to ballot stuffing).” },

Confronted with natural scientists' and McCathythes' accusations of ideological bias, positive studies emphasizing that collective decisions mechanisms were unstable and inefficient, and normative impossibilities, economists largely relied on the idea the policy ends they worked with reflected a “social consensus.” As the latter crumbled in the 1960s, growing disagreement erupted on how to identify and aggregate those individual values which economists believed should guide applied work, in particular in cost-benefit analysis. The 1970s and 1980s brought new approaches to collective decision: Arrow's impossibility was solved by expanding the informational basis, it was showed that true preferences could be revealed by making decision costly, and experimentalists and market designers enabled these mechanisms to be tested in the lab before being sold to those public bodies looking for decision procedures that emulated markets. In this new regime, the focus paradoxically shifted to coordination, revelation and efficiency, and those economists studying collective decision processes were marginalized.},

However, this is a quite large-scale fraud and increases the votes one manages to have by less than the number of fraudulent colluders. In this sense, collusion under QV may not pose much greater problems than the analogous phenomenon, vote buying, under standard one person, one vote (1p1v) rules.” “he (Weyl) considers the possibility that voters are not the perfectly rational and instrumental automata that the basic theory assumes by allowing voters to a) overestimate the chance they are pivotal, b) wish to use their votes to express themselves or c) vote partly to influence the vote total and the signal it sends. So long as the strength of these motives relative to values are not correlated with the values themselves, none interferes with efficiency when the election is not close. In fact, such considerations often accelerate the rate of convergence to efficiency by increasing voting and thus deterring extremists. When the election is close, however, these motives can introduce noise that can cause inefficiency.” Discuss robustness to critcisms Never discuss seats-votes mapping rules or multiple issues.

Traditionally, heuristics have been viewed as learned from the structure of elite debates. This article outlines a different view: that many political heuristics are evolved, biological adaptations that helped our ancestors deal with political problems in small-scale social groups. By analyzing these evolved origins, it becomes possible to develop novel, testable predictions regarding the structure of political heuristics. This argument is illustrated through an extensive review of studies on the structure of the so-called “deservingness” heuristic. The article concludes by outlining four principles that should guide future research on heuristics in political psychology.},

	annote = {"The current consensus in cognitive and developmental psychology is that there is only one efficient solution to this problem: the evolution of content-rich representational systems (Delton \& Sell, 2014; Tooby \& Cosmides, 1992).3 Efficiently identifying situations with adaptive significance requires that our minds are equipped with related concepts, such as “predator,” “mate,” “edible object,” “cooperation partner,” “leader,” “kin,” “cheater,” “enemy,” and so forth, complete with lists of the cues that activate the concept for representing the situation (and evolved mechanisms for adding—“learning”—further cues to the concept). This might be the most fundamental insight from evolutionary psychology, but it is also an exceptionally difficult point to grasp. Some of the central difficulties in appreciating the role of evolved, cognitive categories comes from: (1) “instinct blindness” (Cosmides \& Tooby, 1994); that is, that under our effortless stream of conscious are myriads of evolved, computational processes constantly at work but which are invisible to us; (2) the fact that evolved systems certainly do not have to be present at birth—some of the evolved, representational systems are present at birth, others emerge later in particular life phases, as is the case with physiological adaptations such as female breasts and teeth; and (3) that evolved cognitive categories do not necessarily manifest themselves (i.e., become active) across all individuals or cultures” (54) Yet it could also be a decision-making rule that emerges from the interactions between evolved representational and motivational systems. In such a case, the representational systems determine the input that the heuristic utilizes and the motivational systems determine the output it delivers. In politics, as briefly described in the introduction, the deservingness heuristic is the psychological tendency of people to base their opinions about welfare programs on the efforts of the recipients. Specifically, the heuristic motivates people to support welfare benefits to recipients who are represented as victims of bad luck and reject benefits to recipients who are represented as lazy. “According to Oorschot, people view welfare recipients as deserving of welfare benefits if they (1) are not in control of their own plight, (2) have a high level of need, (3) have contributed to society previously or can be expected to do so in the future, (4) share the same group identity, and (5) express great gratitude.” “Consequently, our evolved psychological systems for regulating help giving are automatically activated, and our attitudes toward social welfare should essentially be guided by the cues that would disclose whether welfare recipients would have been good, cooperating partners in ancestral face-to-face exchange.” Test 1: The Universality of the Deservingness Heuristic Test 2: Social Welfare Attitudes and Everyday Help-Giving Decisions Test 3: The Outputs of the Deservingness Heuristic - Compassion elicits the motivation to confer benefits on individuals who we value but who are in need and cannot, here and now, reciprocate (Batson, Turk, Shaw, \& Klein, 1995). - the detection of cheaters in a sharing situation should trigger anger rather than disgust and contempt. As argued above, anger is optimally geared for punishment and, as repeatedly demonstrated in experimental economics, punishment—or credible threats hereof—is a key tool for up-regulating cooperative motivations in others (Sell et al., 2009). In contrast to anger, contempt and disgust appear to facilitate avoidance (Haidt, 2003). “compassion and anger are tightly regulated by deservingness cues and constitute a key output of the deservingness heuristic.” “the motivational outputs of the deservingness heuristic being narrowly focused on (1) investing in reciprocators through compassion and (2) recalibrating the behavior of cheaters through anger.” Test 4: Competence as Input to the Deservingness Heuristic? Test 5: Sickness as Input to the Deservingness Heuristic “From a “learning” perspective, there is no reason to expect people to reason differently about health care than about unemployment. From an evolutionary perspective, these risks are extremely different” “The category “sick” was more likely to be implicitly associated with bad luck than the category “unemployed.‴' “people are much more likely to associate sickness relative to unemployment with random, uncontrollable causes and, hence, be more supportive of providing benefits to the sick than to the unemployed.” Some weird arguments/assumptions about healthcare issues. Test 6: The Disjunction Between the Deservingness Heuristic and Modern Ideology - "independent of their political ideological position, people support social welfare for recipients who appear to be reciprocators but reject social welfare for recipients who appear to be cheaters.” Test 7: The Reversibility of Cross-National Differences in Welfare Support Test 8: We Assume the Existence of the Deservingness Heuristic in Others and Strategically Exploit It - we find that hunger significantly increases the support for social welfare. - “we also find that while hungry individuals verbally emphasize the importance of sharing, they do not in fact share more with others when they are endowed with actual economic resources in an economic experiment. If anything, hunger makes you cling on to what you can get” Principle 1. Many Political Heuristics Are Evolved, Biological Adaptations Principle 2. The Function of Many Political Heuristics Is to Solve Evolutionarily Recurrent Adaptive Problems Principle 3.

Resent being told “how to feel” about some people.

It removes judgement. It removes facts” (135) How does this relate to the notion of identity? Can it be altered, retold? People want to be hero, have honor.

Show moral character and endure and you will be rewarded with the American Dream of prosperity and security. Line “slows down” (economy changes, more inequality, stagnating wages).

In higher education the subject of audit (in this sense) is not so much the education of the students as the institutional provision for their education. British universities, as institutions, are increasingly subject to national scrutiny for teaching, research and administrative competence. In the wake of this scrutiny comes a new cultural apparatus of expectations and technologies. While the metaphor of financial auditing points to the important values of accountability, audit does more than monitor—it has a life of its own that jeopardizes the life it audits. The runaway character of assessment practices is analysed in terms of cultural practice. Higher education is intimately bound up with the origins of such practices, and is not just the latter day target of them.},

	abstract = {Earnings inequality in the United States has increased rapidly over the last three decades, but little is known about the role of firms in this trend. For example, how much of the rise in earnings inequality can be attributed to rising dispersion between firms in the average wages they pay, and how much is due to rising wage dispersion among workers within firms? Similarly, how did rising inequality affect the wage earnings of different types of workers working for the same employer—men vs. women, young vs. old, new hires vs. senior employees, and so on? To address questions like these, we begin by constructing a matched employer-employee data set for the United States using administrative records. Covering all U.S. firms between 1978 to 2012, we show that virtually all of the rise in earnings dispersion between workers is accounted for by increasing dispersion in average wages paid by the employers of these individuals. In contrast, pay differences within employers have remained virtually unchanged, a finding that is robust across industries, geographical regions, and firm size groups. Furthermore, the wage gap between the most highly paid employees within these firms (CEOs and high level executives) and the average employee has increased only by a small amount, refuting oft-made claims that such widening gaps account for a large fraction of rising inequality in the population.},

	abstract = {Can stronger state-level public policies help protect workers from “wage theft?” In recent years, workers' rights groups have responded to policy drift and legislative inaction at the national level by launching campaigns to enact stronger penalties for wage and hour violations at the state level. Many of these campaigns have been legislatively successful and formative for the development of “alt-labor.” But are such policies actually effective in deterring wage theft? Previous scholarship has long concluded that although stronger penalties should theoretically make a difference, in practice, they do not. But by confining the analysis to the admittedly weak national-level regulatory regime, the existing literature has eliminated all variation from the costs side of the equation and overlooked the rich variety of employment laws that exist at the state level. Using an original dataset of state laws, new estimates of minimum wage violations, and difference-in-differences analyses of a dozen recently enacted “wage-theft laws,” I find that stronger penalties can, in fact, serve as an effective deterrent against wage theft, but the structure of the policy matters a great deal, as does its enforcement. The implications for workers' rights and the changing shape of the labor movement are discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on contracting problems in firms caused by asset specificity and investment incentives, particularly the problems that arise when employees make investments in "firm specific human capital." In such cases, employee investments will also be seriously at risk in the enterprise. Under the nexus of contracts theory of corporations, corporation law is viewed as providing a standardized solution to a central contracting problem, namely the agency problem between shareholders (who are assumed to be the "owners" of the firm) and their hired managers. All other relationships are seen as governed by ordinary, negotiated contracts. But where employees make important specific investments, it is no longer appropriate to assume that shareholders are, and should be, the hiring party, or the "owners." A broader view of what a firm is, and what corporation law accomplishes, is needed, one that permits exploration of why one set of participants in the firm might end up with certain control rights rather than some other set. For a firm in which such firm-specific employee investments are important, one would expect, for example, to find institutional arrangements that are central to the nature of the firm and that encourage continuity in the relationships between employees and the firm, as well as give employees the means to protect their stakes. Such institutions might include unions, severance pay, and social norms of lifetime employment, together with internal job ladders, career paths, seniority rules, and direct and formal control rights. The paper then reviews several new theories that view the firm alternately as a system of incentives, or as a nexus of specific investments. In other words, they conceptualize the firm as a mechanism for governing the relationships among all the participants (those who contribute labor as well as those who contribute capital), not just the relationship between shareholders and managers.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonicalmodel, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods. Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts. In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: (1) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; (2) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; (3) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job “polarization”); (4) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately skilled workers; and (5) expanding offshoring in opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers specific tasks. Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities. We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor. We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized. We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration},

Analyzing this phenomenon within the canonical production function framework is challenging, however, because the assignment of tasks to labor and capital in the canonical model is essentially static. This essay sketches an alternative model of the assignment of skills to tasks based upon comparative advantage, reviews key conceptual and practical challenges that researchers face in bringing the “task approach” to the data, and cautions against two common pitfalls that pervade the growing task literature. I conclude with a cautiously optimistic forecast for the potential of the task approach to illuminate the interactions among skill supplies, technological capabilities, and trade and offshoring opportunities, in shaping the aggregate demand for skills, the assignment of skills to tasks, and the evolution of wages},

Workers apply their skills to tasks in exchange for wages. Canonical production functions draw an implicit equivalence between workers' skills and their job tasks. Here, we emphasize instead that skills are applied to tasks to produce output—skills do not directly produce output” (186) “a key premise of the task approach is that although skills are used to perform tasks, skills are not tasks. To understand how and why shifts in technology and trade affect skill demands and earnings, we therefore need to be able to measure the mapping between skills and tasks and observe the changes in this mapping over time” 3 approaches to resolving problem: 1) use occupations as proxies for tasks and then boil down to small dimension object, e.g., broad categories of occupations. But obscures any similarities in task content that cross broad occupational boundaries. 2) append a set of standardized job descriptors to each occupation. (O*NET) But assigning task measures to occupations overlooks all heterogeneity in job tasks among individuals within an occupation. And task measures assigned at the occupational level offer a static view of the tasks an occupation comprises. And O*NET is too slow to evolve: job content measures are often vague, repetitive, and constructed using ambiguous and value-laden scales that are likely to confuse respondents. 3) collect job task information directly on surveys. E.g., IAB/BIBB data set. “One lesson these recent initiatives offer is that designing survey questions that successfully measure routine, codifiable tasks is itself a challenging task. The heart of the difficulty is that what is routine from the perspective of human labor is generally not routine from the perspective of machine automation and vice versa” “Counterfactual problem: how a task-replacing technological change (or an increase in own labor supply) affects the earnings of M workers depends importantly on how productive M labor is in alternative uses—that is, in the tasks to which it is not initially assigned.” Ideally we'd want human analgoue to agronomic data: potential productivity of each parcel of land for producing all food crops, not simply those with which it is currently planted “A key implication of the theoretical framework above is that holding the task efficiencies (that is, the α(·) s) constant, changes in the market value of tasks should affect the evolution of wages by skill group. In particular, the model predicts that if the relative market price of the tasks in which a skill group holds comparative advantage declines, the relative wage of that skill group should also decline—even if the group reallocates its labor to a different set of tasks (i.e., due to the change in its comparative advantage). Critical to this prediction is the distinction made between the wages paid to a skill group and the wages paid to a given task” “One important implication of this set of observations is that the intuitively appealing approach of regressing wages on current tasks performed by workers to estimate the “returns to tasks” may generate potentially misleading results{\textbackslash}ldots.At the heart of the Mincerian approach is the observation that a worker's human capital, proxied by schooling, is a quasi-fixed stock variable, determined prior to labor market entry{\textbackslash}ldotsBy contrast, the set of tasks that a worker performs on the job is an endogenous state variable that is simultaneously determined by the worker's stock of human capital and the contemporaneous productivity of the tasks that human capital could accomplish. This implies that task assignments are themselves a function of the current wage distribution, and hence a regression of wages on job tasks (rather than on worker skills) will be inherently difficult to interpret.” emerging task literature may be significantly inside the frontier of what is feasible in terms of precise terminology and consistent measurement. Addressing these shortcomings should therefore be a high priority on the research agenda since it is difficult for a field to advance when researchers lack shared definitions of core constructs or consistent measures of these constructs.},

We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem-solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.},

Using population data on firms between 1995 and 2007, we structurally estimate the key parameters of our model to construct counterfactual size, productivity, and welfare distributions. We find that the cost of these regulations is equivalent to that of a 2.3 percent variable tax on labor. In our baseline case with French levels of partial real wage inflexibility, welfare costs of the regulations are 3.4 percent of GDP ( falling to 1.3 percent if real wages were perfectly flexible downward).

FICUS employee counting: A headcount of employees is taken on the last day of the fiscal year (usually December 31st) and on the last day at the end of each of the previous three quarters. Employment is then the simple arithmetic average over these four days: this “smoothing” of headcounts renders this concept closer to full time equivalent jobs. DADS employee counting/French Statistical institute: full time equivalents are computed from “non-annexes” jobs only, i.e. those lasting more than 30 days with more than 1.5 hours worked per day, or those that were associated with (total) gross earnings higher than three times the monthly minimum wage. in 2002, the “non-annexes” jobs represented 76.6\% of all jobs, which means that almost a quarter of the most short-end, low paid jobs were removed. This is unfortunate as these jobs are in fact covered by labor laws. Note also that the type of contract (full time vs. part time) is not observed in the DADS data: it is estimated from the 75th percentile of the distribution of hours paid/worked per job (in firms having 20 to 1,000 workers). Unfortunately, this strategy only provides approximations of full time equivalents because the implementation of the mandatory 35 hour work week in 2000 was complex and differentiated across firms, which renders the relation between hours and full time equivalents heterogeneous across firms.

We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in administrative data using the universe of social security records in Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10–15\% relative to similar jobs that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics services alone accounts for around 9\% of the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s.

Focuses on logistics, cleaning, security, and food services (FCSL) Can't look at independent contractors in German data. Focus on JOB LEVEL analysis, not the displaced worker per se. very general measure of outsourcing: the share of workers in food, cleaning, security, or logistics occupations who are working for business service firms on-site outsourcing. This type of outsourcing refers to situations where a large employer spins off a group of workers providing a particular service, such as cafeteria workers, to a legally separate business unit, such as a subsidiary or an existing business service provider. In these situations the outsourced workers still work together and do essentially the same job at the same physical location, but under a different employer. Basic logic: if we observe a group of workers splitting off from a large bank in year t – 1 and forming a new establishment identifier in year t with an industry code of “cafeteria,” this likely reflects that the bank is outsourcing its cafeteria. This is further supported if the workers who are leaving worked in food related jobs in year t – 1 at the bank, and the bank does not replace these occupations in the following year Our main contribution is to estimate the wage effect of outsourcing using two approaches. We first show that workers who are outsourced in on-site outsourcing events typically stay with the business service firm they are outsourced to for the following years, and their employment is similarly stable compared with workers in the same occupations and industries who are not outsourced. Comparing the evolution of wages of outsourced workers before and after outsourcing to similar nonoutsourced workers, we find that wages fall by around 10\% over 10 years. As a second method of estimating the wage losses from outsourcing, we compare wages of workers in logistics, cleaning, food, and security occupations who are employed in business service firms with those employed directly by other employers, controlling for individual fixed effects. 5 This yields almost identical estimates of thewage penalty of outsourcing. workers who are outsourced at employers that pay higher rents tend to experience higher wage losses. Finally, we document that establishments that pay above market wages or are covered by collective bargaining agreements are more likely to outsource parts of their labor force. These findings suggest that exclusion from establishment wage premia is a driving factor for the wage losses and likely part of the motivation for why firms outsource. outsourcing of cleaning, security and logistics workers alone can account for about 9\% of the increased wage dispersion in Germany Although work councils have to be consulted for a wide variety of firm-level decisions that affect workers, this does not apply to outsourcing decisions, and German firms are legally free to do so at their discretion “Integrated Employment Biographies data (IEB), which represents the universe of social security records in Germany over the time period 1975–2009.12 The IEB has been made available through the Research Data Center of the German Federal Employment Agency at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB){\textbackslash}ldotsThis report contains information on the duration of employment, the total pay over that period, the employment type (full-time, part-time, apprentice), and a number of demographic variables (such as education, nationality, gender, and age). The pay information, used for social insurance calculations, is very accurate but top coded” WHO FILLS OUT REPORTS? HOW IS OCCUPATION DECIDED/CODED? DATA contain only establishment, not firm, identifiers. “We define a clustered flow of workers to be a group of workers who were all employed in establishment A, the predecessor, in one year and then in the following year were all employed in establishment B, the successor. A clustered flow at time t is considered an on-site outsourcing event if the following conditions hold: first, the flow must consist of 10 employees or more to eliminate small flows that may be a part of regular year-to-year worker movements. The predecessor establishment must have at least 50 employees in the year prior to the flow, continue to exist in the following year, and not shrink by more than 50\%, to ensure that the flow we observe is not due to an establishment closing, severely downsizing, or breaking apart. The flow must also represent less than 30\% of employment in the predecessor in the previous year, so that we are certain that the outsourced employees represent only a small part of the predecessor's business.16 Finally, we restrict the successor establishment to have an industry code corresponding to a business service firm in either logistics, food services, cleaning, or security, and ensure that the predecessor establishment is not a business service firm” Must assume that workers in same occupation and location but different firm are doing the same job.

To address these problems, the potential path forward could include mandating data sharing for key sources, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency by making it easier for agencies to share data (including developing standards, templates, and incentives). We argue that an agency within the federal statistical system should serve as an intermediary for data integration across the federal statistical system and that the U.S. Census Bureau, with its experience and uniquely broad authority to seek data from any public or private entity for statistical purposes, is well positioned to fill this role.},

Until the 1950s, Ghent systems relied primarily on contributions by the insured and provided meager benefits. As a result, they failed to incentivize workers to join unions. With data for 1930 to 2010, we show that the Ghent effect identified by the existing literature pertains only to Ghent systems that are financed by employer contributions or general tax revenues” (2-3) “Sweden is the only case of Ghent being introduced by a Left government (out of 11 Ghent introductions between 1900 and 1935). Left governments more commonly opted for state-administered unemployment insurance and in several instances (Norway, Spain, and the Netherlands) initiated the replacement of Ghent systems by state-administered systems in the 1930s and 1940s” (3) “In most countries, unionization was too low for Ghent to be a viable alternative to state-administered insurance for the Left{\textbackslash}ldotsGhent was an attractive option for progressive Liberals because the scheme was voluntary and, as envisaged at the time, did not entail any significant redistribution of income in favor of workers. The Swedish case is exceptional not only on account of the weakness of liberalism, but also, and above all, on account of the high-level unionization that had been achieved before the Social Democrats came to power in 1932. Our account stands Rothstein on his head in that unionization explains why it was rational for the Swedish Social Democrats to embrace the Ghent design of unemployment insurance in the 1930s” (3) “ Left government is associated with less reliance on contributions by the insured to finance Ghent systems.” Left wants more subsidy for UI. Key attribute of Ghent system: “what all of these systems have in common boils down to this: Unions set the conditions of eligibility for unemployment benefits and participate directly in the process whereby it is decided whether or not unemployed workers satisfy these conditions” (4) Table 1 is important.

We consider several actual and hypothetical sustainable PAYGO pension structures, including: (1) versions of the US Social Security system with annual adjustments of taxes or benefits to maintain fiscal balance; (2) Sweden's Notional Defined Contribution system and several variants developed to improve fiscal stability; and (3) the German system, which also includes annual adjustments to maintain fiscal balance. For each system, we present descriptive measures of uncertainty in representative outcomes for a typical generation and across generations. We then estimate expected utility for generations based on simplifying assumptions and incorporate these expected utility calculations in an overall social welfare measure. Using a horizontal equity index, we also compare the different systems' performance in terms of how neighboring generations are treated. While the actual Swedish system smoothes stochastic fluctuations more than any other and produces the highest degree of horizontal equity, it does so by accumulating a buffer stock of assets that alleviates the need for frequent adjustments. In terms of social welfare, this accumulation of assets leads to a lower average rate of return that more than offsets the benefits of risk reduction, leaving systems with more frequent adjustments that spread risks broadly among generations as those most preferred.},

We have developed an innovative visual representation for Internet surveys that has some advantages over previously used formats. In this paper we present our findings from testing this visual representation in the context of individuals' Social Security expectations. Respondents are asked to allocate a total of 20 balls across seven bins to express what they believe the chances to be that their future Social Security benefits would fall into any one of those bins. Our data come from the Internet survey of respondents to the Health and Retirement Study, a representative survey of the U.S. population aged 51 and older. To contrast the results from the visual format with a previously used format, we divided the sample into two random groups and administered both, the visual format and the more standard percent chance format. Our findings suggest that the main advantage of the visual format is that it generates usable answers for virtually all respondents in the sample while in the percent chance format a significant fraction (about 20 percent) of responses is lost due to inconsistencies. Across various other dimensions, the visual format performs similarly to the percent chance format, leading us to conclude that the bins-and-balls format is a viable alternative that leads to more complete data.},

Put differently, national American surveys across the past five decades have found that most White Americans accept basic principles of equal opportunity while, at the same time, resisting the implementation of policies that would increase equality directly by helping outgroups. The second emotion measure used by Ziegler et al. (2013) was an adaptation of Pettigrew and Meertens's (1995) measure of subtle racism. It consisted of two items asking “How often have you felt \_\_\_\_\_ for African Americans who grew up in slums and poverty?” The blank was replaced by “sympathy” or “admiration” in the two items. The same items were also used to ask about “Americans” in place of “African Americans.” We will explain why most research procedures used in studies of prejudice are inadequate to distinguish ingroup favoritism from outgroup hostility as mechanisms of discrimination{\textbackslash}ldotsTo distinguish ingroup favoritism from outgroup hostility as a cause of discrimination, a study must meet two requirements. First, the study's measures must distinguish favorableness from hostility in thoughts, feelings, or behavior toward others. To do this, a measure must have an unambiguous neutral point—a value that is neither favorable nor hostile. Second, the study must use a design that permits comparison between behavior toward ingroup members and behavior toward outgroup members 1) Overt behavior measures: helping v. no helping; no measure of harm. we could find just seven laboratory studies in which discrimination was assessed using measures that appeared unambiguously to involve outgroupdirected hostile behavior. The behaviors were electric shock administration in six and aversive noise administration in the seventh 2) nonverbal behavior measures: rarely have neutral point. 3) behavioral intention 4) interprersonal judgements 5) self reported attitude 6) implicit attitude. “It is remarkable that relatively few studies have used dependent measures that assessed unequivocally hostile behavior. This paucity cannot be explained simply in terms of experimenters' benevolence” (678) “For whatever reason, it is apparently easier to demonstrate discrimination in the form of differential favoritism than in the form of differential hostility. The most parsimonious and plausible explanation is that, indeed, discrimination more often takes the form of ingroup favoritism than outgroup hostility. However, some portion of this imbalance in findings may also be due to the greater ease of meeting ethical research standards in laboratory studies that use measures of benign behavior than in ones investigating hostile behavior.” “L. Gaertner and Insko's (2001) multiple alternative matrices procedure for the minimal group paradigm comes closest to meeting this combination of requirements but is not adapted to investigating face-toface intergroup interactions. The most important method recommendation is to use measures—whether nonverbal, behavioral, self-report, or implicit—that have unambiguous neutral points that enable distinguishing between favoring and hostile responses” “we do claim that much discrimination occurs without hostile intent; it occurs either as a consequence of social structures (such as the self-sustaining properties of segregation in schools, homes, workplaces, and institutional discrimination) or as a consequence of mental processes that lack animus (such as norms, similarity–attraction, and the judgment processes that we labeled illusory individuation).”},

UI: State plans must have (1) benefits paid through state employment office of other agency approved by SSB; (2) no benefits until 2 yrs after first contributions; (3) state fund monies depositied in Treasury, ear-marked trust fund. SSA wants to contol state UI offices and policies. Hard to do. limited success in study period. Social Security: Must begin collecting payroll taxes on 1 Jan 1937 No monthly benefits paid out until 1942. BUT: anyone reaching 65 after 1/1/37 and before 1/1/42 is eligible for a lump sum payment of 3.5\% of wages since 12/31/36 up until 65th birthday “Payroll taxes had been adopted despite their regressive tendencies. The issue was, in the President's words `politics all the way through.' `We put payroll contributions there,' he said, `so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes there is no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.‴ [17; quoted from Leuchtenburg, Roosevelt and the New Deal, p. 133] Foreign consultants: concern about separation of tax collecting (Treasury) and info-collecting (SSA) functions. States seeking help in drafting UI bills and designing systems. SSA overwhelmed in 1936. Major problem was lack of professionalism in many state bureaucracies. The roll out of old age pensions: Struggle to staff the old age pensions section. Need to ramp up quickly. civil service rules were a concern but were ultimately respected (probably due to slack labor market). Confirming workers' ages was not an easy thing. Census was expected to help. director of old age benefits was absorbed with duties relating to railroad workers. Decided that SSA would have to do registration itself. Big fight over what SSNs would be and look like. Intersting problems with early computing and whether there should be alphanumeric SSNs. Fight over what info to collect. Decided to collect race info (word used is “color”) b/c of differences in life expectancies. Some argued for asking about religion since “many employers specified that members of certain faiths were unacceptable. The Employment Service took the position that it was better to send an employer people he wanted rather than to let an employee begin a job and then be fired because if religious prejudice.” (326) Questions of whether to collection union affiliation. Fight over term to use for registration. Official term ends up as “assignment of account numbers.” 1936 election had huge effect on timing of SS registration. Strong pressure to wait until after the presidential election to start sending out forms and enrolling employers and workers. Lots of hemming and hawing on timing. On purely administrative basis, get started sooner; waiting until after 1/1/37 would cause huge tax headaches for employers. Finally decided in 6/36 to start registration after the election. SSA would do the registration work. Employer opinion solicited. Post Office was ultimately key in roll out of registration process. Required Presidential pressure to get USPS to buy in fully, 9/15/36. Postmen recorded the employers on their routes. Employer census from postal workers ultimately destroyed before being turned over to IRS/Treasury (serious fuck up) SSA kept a low profile and did not enage in serious publicity or other actions to raise public awareness or advocate for registration until Landon campaign (9/26/36) and republicans began stuffing workers' payroll envelopes with anti-SS propaganda. But once campaign started then SSA division of information services swung into action. Newsreels; interviews. SSB vigorously cooperated with Democratic party and labor in the weeks before the election. Released We the People and Social Security newsreel [NEED TO FIND THIS.] Released “Security in Your Old Age” 9pp. pamphlet [NEED TO FIND THIS] “The first paragraph of this circular was changed, because social security had become and issue in the election, to read:`There is now a law in this country which will give about 26 million working people something to live on when they are old and have stopped working. This law, which gives other benefits too, was passed last year by Congress and is called the Social Security Act.‴(358) “One evening 125 members of the Social Security Board staff, including some executives, stuffed 33,000 envelopes with 100 copies each of this circular to be sent to 33,000 local AFL unions throughout the country, following upon a letter sent out by William Green, president of the national AFL” (358) Republican attack a “blessing in diguise because it awakened the American public to the fact that there was a Social Security Act, and because it made it possible to run a quick and effective publicity campaign.” (359) tons of last minute timing changes and questions; personality fights about titles and who has control over regional directors and field office managers. Treasury sent out a different tax form to employers about UI insurance at same time as SS-4 (employer) tax form went out, so some confusion. Between 11/16/26 and 2/15/37 there were 23647000 received appications for SSNs. This study not able to really judge quality of roll out. But seems like post office did a reasonable job. Serious problems with roll out of interim, lump-sum benefits. Method and forms for confirming benefit eligibility were onerous and complicated and largely not worth the effort. Field offices had strong concerns that there would be serious backlash. Caused problems but ultimately no coverage or backlash. },

Hence, studies have used either measures of self-reported unemployment duration in the Current Population Survey (CPS) or the duration of UI benefit receipt from administrative records{\textbackslash}ldotsthe CPS-based measure is in principle preferable. However, the CPS measure is noisy and does not capture worker's total length of nonemployment, which may include periods in which workers do not declare themselves unemployed. Although the administrative data from the UI system have information on quarterly earnings, and hence could be used to study nonemployment durations, this is quite coarse. SomeUS studies based on administrative data focused onUI benefit duration and the spike at benefit exhaustion as main outcomes. However, although the duration of UI benefits and, in particular, the UI exhaustion rate are indeed key components in the welfare evaluation of UI benefit extensions, neither captures the employment effects of UI parameters, as the majority of workers do not return to work immediately after benefit exhaustion Many recent European studies make use of spell-based administrative data, which allow researchers to measure the duration of UI benefit receipt and nonemployment, as well as the incidence of benefit exhaustion. The nature of the data does not allow measuring unemployment as defined in labor force surveys, as information on individuals' job search activity is usually not available.” (555-556)},

As an alternative approach, this paper uses survey data to investigate interpersonal preferences.

These interpersonal preferences are characterized by a negative exposure effect—individuals decrease their support for welfare as the welfare recipiency rate in their community rises—and racial group loyalty—individuals increase their support for welfare spending as the share of local recipients from their own racial group rises. These findings help to explain why levels of welfare benefits are relatively low in racially heterogeneous states.},

To make promises credible parties should appeal to identifiable groups because if party reneges then voters will presumably punish the defector [Link with PiM and the politics of divided societies work. ] groups must have - excludability \& identifiability (who's in and who's out; easily verified and not manipulable by voters) - unwilling to share outside group (why men v women is not a typical basis for partisan competition) Argues the “class” and ethnicity are the dominant group markers. Central assumption: parties can only credibly commit to representing a particular class or particular ethnic group; cannot commit to representing arbitrary coalitions Party will form and appeal to the cleavage/group that will produce the smallest majority. If majority ethnic proportion greater than majority class proportion then we get “class politics” i.e., redistribution from rich to poor. [If inequality sufficiently low relative to ethnic homogeneity] If majority ethnic proportion less than majority class proportion then we get “ethnic politics” i.e., splitting the poor against itself. Why do other parties form when they will lose? Form to keep the leader of the winning party honest; w/o threat of loss then promise is not credible. Challenger party will form along the opposite axis (e.g., under class politics the challenger will be an ethnic party from majority ethnic group). Founder/leader of challenger party will be from the group benefiting from the winning party (e.g., under class politics leader of ethnic challenger party will be from the non-rich). In elections, each party offers the its voters the amount they would receive if the losing party won. Party entrepreneurs always receive positive rents. Ch. 5: EITM and measurement: Ethnic polarization: reaches maximum value when there are two equally-sized groups. 1) as the proportion of non-rich increases (holding ethnic divisions fixed) it is more difficult for class parties to win. As ethnic polarization increases (size of majority group's majority decreases) it is easier for ethnic party to win 2) when ethnic politics prevails rich and poor split their votes; when class politics prevails rich vote together and poor vote together. aka: as inequality increases (holding ethnic polarization fixed) there should be weaker relationship between vote choice and income. 3) When ethnic politics prevails then less rich-to-poor redistribution. Contrasts with antipathy approach in which level of inequality should have no effect on redistribution. 4) When ethnic polarization is high then democracy is less expensive for autocratic elites so transitions are easier. Chapter 6: a justification of the EITM approach vs. causal ID-driven research. Basic answer: ID-driven reseaerch prevents us from asking certain kinds of questions, esp those about social structure and broad macro stuff. Also hard in interpret in an eqbm framework. External validity questions. chapters 7-9: a whole set of X-national regressions on: support for redistribution; level of redistribution; ethnification of political parties; democratic transitions.

The other, based on self-interest, combines an “insurance” model of preferences for redistribution with increasingly segmented labor markets, in which immigration of workers without recognized skills leaves most native workers better off but intensifies competition for low-end jobs.

Belying the popular narrative surrounding so-called “red state socialism,” we find that simple hypocrisy does not explain this paradox—individuals who are likely to benefit from spending tend to support it. But, income is a more powerful predictor of opinion on spending in “taker” states than “giver” states, heightening state-level opposition in the former. There is also more to the story than economic self-interest. Symbolic racism is four times more powerful than income in explaining opposition to spending, and there are more people with such attitudes in states receiving more federal money.},

In the changed political and electoral environment of the knowledge economy, effective compensation, we argue, depends on the formation of coalitions between and/or within parties that include the interests of lower income groups. Such inclusion is no longer possible in contemporary majoritarian systems where parties have to target skilled workers and professionals for electoral support. In contrast, under Fordism, parties targeted semiskilled workers, as they were at least partially decisive voters who also had a voice in the industrial relations system. Inequality has risen in majoritarian systems as a consequence of this shift. In systems of proportional representation (pr), the outcome depends on how the party system ties economically defined groups to parties and the process of government formation. We build on the Iversen and Soskice (is) 2006 model,5 which predicts center-left coalitions, but depart from it by showing that it is possible to sustain center, and even mildly center-right, coalitions when parties are organized on a crossclass basis and—our prima facie paradoxical result—independent right-wing parties are weak Pessimistic about long term sustainability; Social Democrats need to abandon the low skill to the far right.

Once all individuals make a decision, the lottery contest success function determines winner. Total group effort is sum of group account across members of a group. Winning prob for group is group'r proportion of total contributions to group accounts across all groups \& subjects. Each member of winning group is awarded 40 ECUs. Subjects informed of the total ECUs in their group account, the total ECUs in the other group's group account, which group has won the prize, and their individual earnings in ECUs from that period.Three-player groups and aggregated information feedback ensure no in-group reputation effect. "This contest is repeated for 20 periods. Subjects cannot use past earnings in future periods and receive a fresh endowment of 60 ECUs in every period. At the end of the session, each subject is shown their individual earnings in ECUs in each of the 20 periods. All subjects are then paid for the same 5 periods chosen randomly at the rate of 25 ECUs to 1 GBP. "In all treatments 9 subjects from each of the two racial cohorts, East Asians and Whites (Caucasians), participate in a session. Within each cohort, subjects are randomly and anonymously assigned to groups of three. Two groups – one from each racial cohort – are then randomly and anonymously paired. Thus, all three members of a group are from the same racial cohort and the two competing groups are composed of subjects from the two different racial cohorts.7 The matching within and between groups remains fixed throughout a session." "It is important to clarify our subject-recruitment strategy due to the specific nature of the experiment. All the subjects were students at the University of East Anglia, UK. In this university there are similar proportions of White Caucasian and East Asian students, who together constitute around 90\% of the student population. Hence, it is convenient to implement racial identity in the laboratory, and to recruit White and East Asian subjects, without raising suspicion – as almost all other experiments have similar racial compositions in subject cohorts. We sent recruitment emails only to East Asian and White subjects from the university subject-database through ORSEE (Greiner, 2015). We filtered using participants' self-reported country of citizenship (Northern Europe, Western Europe, USA, Canada etc. for Whites; and China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan etc. for East Asians) and their name. The second criterion, name, filtered out students whose name do not seem to be one of the two racial categories (e.g. Latino students from the USA or British students of Indian origin). We recruited more subjects than required, and randomly chose 9 subjects from each race at the start of a session. The remaining recruited subjects received a turn-away fee. We also ensured that ethnically the subjects entering the laboratory are indeed Whites or East Asians. In only one case a Black student with Western name from the USA showed up and received a turn- away fee; we did not include her in that session." "We employ three between-subject treatments and four sessions in each treatment. In the Baseline (no identity) treat- ment no information about the group composition is revealed. In the instructions we use phrases such as `your group' and the `group you are matched with'. In the Color (`classification' or `minimal identity') treatment the same experiment is run, but each group is arbitrarily given a different color code – either Green or Blue. The instructions in this treatment mention, at the beginning, that everyone in their group is of the same color code and that everyone in the group they are matched with is of the other color code. All the remaining parts of the instruction remain the same as in the Baseline. To test if there "are any interactions between race and the color code, in half the Color sessions, East Asians were in the Green group while Caucasians were in the Blue group (Green–Blue). The color codes were reversed in the other half of the sessions (Blue–Green). In the Race (real identity) treatment the racial compositions of the groups are revealed. The subjects are informed at the beginning of the instructions that everyone in their group is of the same race and that everyone in the group they are matched with is of the other race. The remaining parts of the instruction stay the same as in the Baseline. The instructions are available in the Appendix." "The experiment involved a total of 216 subjects who could participate in only one session. No subject had prior experience in participating in a contest or in an identity experiment. Sessions were computerized using z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007), and was run by an East-Asian and a White research assistant. At the beginning of each session, instructions were handed out and were read aloud by an experimenter. No other information, including details of race, was disseminated. Subjects were required to answer a quiz before the experiment began. Each session lasted 60 min and average earning per subject was 16 GBP Hypotheses: "Hypothesis 1. (Sen, 2007: Identity). Effort expended in the Race treatment is significantly higher than the effort expended" "in the Baseline treatment." "Hypothesis 2. (Sen, 2007: Classification). Effort expended in the Color treatment is not significantly different from the effort expended in the Baseline treatment." "Hypothesis 3. (Homogeneous effect). Change in individual effort expended between treatments is the same across racial groups." Results: "Result 1. Group efforts are higher in the Race treatment than in the Baseline treatment. But there is no difference between" "group efforts in the Color and in the Baseline treatment. While the current design is enough to answer our specific research questions the results cannot tease out the effects of identity on in-group cooperation versus out-group hate. Hence, the most we can conclude from these results is that a real identity has a direct effect on parochial altruism (Choi and Bowles, 2007; Halevy et al., 2008; Abbink et al., 2012, Weisel and Böhm, 2015, Weisel and Zultan, 2016). That is, the incremental effect of identity in conflict efforts can come either through an increase in group cooperation for the love of own group's identity, or through an increase in hate for the other group's identity. It is observed in the literature (as discussed in the introduction) that in a public good game an introduction of identity can indeed increase contribution due to in-group love. But to incur out-group hate, one will have to face a threat from the out-group (Weisel and" "Böhm, 2015)." "Result 2. The incidence of free-riding is lower in the Race treatment than in the Baseline treatment. Color treatment does not" "show such a difference." "Result 3. Individual efforts are higher in the Race treatment than in the Baseline treatment, but they are not higher in the" "Color treatment compared to the Baseline treatment." "Result 4. The higher efforts in the Race treatment relative to those in the Baseline treatment are driven by the higher efforts expended by female subjects. Females also expend significantly higher effort in the Race treatment compared to the Color treatment. However, there is no significant difference in efforts expended by females between the Color and the Baseline" "treatment, neither there is any difference in effort expended by racial groups."},

Departing from the dominant focus on membership size, we argue that unions' influence on national lawmaking is based to an important degree on their local organization. We delineate the novel hypothesis that the horizontal concentration of union members within electoral districts matters. To test it, we draw on administrative records and map the membership size and concentration of local unions to districts of the U.S. House of Representatives, 2003-2012. We find that, controlling for membership size, representatives from districts with less concentrated unions have more liberal voting records than their peers. This concentration effect survives numerous district controls and relaxing OLS assumptions. While surprising for several theoretical perspectives, it is consistent with theories based on social incentives. These results have implications for our broader understanding of political representation and the role of groups in democratic politics.},

Economics/RC implicity expect “prices would do the work of morals” Social utility/morals and incentive utility are (often) not additively separable. But what about using incentives to dampen anti-social motivations??? incomplete contracts and problems with property rights again play a role in the development of customs/norms and the public policies. “Because contracts are incomplete, morals must sometimes do the work of prices rather than the other way around.” (34-35) Preferences that determine citizen response to policy are a function of policy. “experienced values” are proximate motive to contribute to public good/at pro-socially. Method to test for marginal \& categorical crowding out/in: design experiment such that predicted consequences for a homo economicus is benchmark. Then observe deviations. Categorical crowding out vs. marginal crowding out. Categorical: presence of incentive (rather than amount) affects experienced values. Marginal: when extent of incentives matters. Mechanisms: (1) incentives affect preferences because they provide cues to the nature of the situation. Situation-dependent preferences; incentive structure part of the situation. (2) incentives alter the process by which people come to aquire preferences over the lifetime: endogenous preferences. May alter process by which people come to develop tastes. incentives as information: reveal the presumed motive of the designer of incentives. incentives can trigger moral disengagement: incentives not emerging from another strategic player in the game, but by someone else. adverse reaction to control appears less of an issue in experimental literature ( Falk \& Kosfeld; Burdin et al.)

Information dragnets increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which are analyzed to sort and slot people into categories of taste, riskiness or worth. These tools deepen the reach of the market and define new strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for understanding their development. We argue that (a) modern organizations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible; (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data, individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets. We discuss the implications of these processes and argue that they tend toward a new economy of moral judgment, where outcomes are experienced as morally deserved positions based on prior good actions and good tastes, as measured and classified by this new infrastructure of data collection and analysis.},

Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2n−1 to 2n, thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.},

	abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

(Since you have many more parameters than data, you can find many sets of parameters that perfectly fit the data.) They look in detail at a model that is easy to train (random fourier features) and show explicitly that they can improve performance in the overfitting regime by imposing a constraint on the smoothness. They hypothesize that a similar thing can happen with neural nets even if you don’t add extra constraints because the standard way to train neural nets (stochastic gradient descent) has a bias towards finding smoother functions},

                Climate change threatens the planet, and yet policy responses have varied widely across nations. Some countries have undertaken ambitious programs to stave off climate disaster, others have done little, and still others have passed policies that were later rolled back. In this book, Matto Mildenberger opens the “black box” of domestic climate politics, examining policy making trajectories in several countries and offering a theoretical explanation for national differences in the climate policy process.Mildenberger introduces the concept of double representation—when carbon polluters enjoy political representation on both the left (through industrial unions fearful of job loss) and the right (through industrial business associations fighting policy costs)—and argues that different climate policy approaches can be explained by the interaction of climate policy preferences and domestic institutions. He illustrates his theory with detailed histories of climate politics in Norway, the United States, and Australia, along with briefer discussions of policies in in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada. He shows that Norway systematically shielded politically connected industrial polluters from costs beginning with its pioneering carbon tax; the United States, after the failure of carbon reduction legislation, finally acted on climate reform through a series of Obama administration executive actions; and Australia's Labor and Green parties enacted an emissions trading scheme, which was subsequently repealed by a conservative Liberal party government. Ultimately, Mildenberger argues for the importance of political considerations in understanding the climate policymaking process and discusses possible future policy directions.},

	abstract = {The U.S. medical system is touted as the most advanced in the world, yet many common treatments are not based on sound science. Treatments can go into widespread use before they are rigorously evaluated, and every year patients are harmed because they receive too many procedures—and too few treatments that really work. Unhealthy Politics sheds new light on why the government’s response to this troubling situation has been so inadequate, and why efforts to improve the evidence base of U.S. medicine continue to cause so much political controversy and public trepidation.

This critically important book draws on public opinion surveys, physician surveys, case studies, and political science models to explain how political incentives, polarization, and the misuse of professional authority have undermined efforts to tackle the medical evidence problem and curb wasteful spending. It paints a portrait of a medical industry with vast influence over which procedures and treatments get adopted, and a public burdened by the rising costs of health care yet fearful of going against “doctor’s orders.” The book shows how the government’s efforts to promote evidence-based medicine have become mired in partisan debates. It also proposes sensible solutions that can lead to better, more efficient health care for all of us.

	abstract = {show that households have attained unprecedented prosperity, and wages have (at worst) held their own against
inflation, or (at best) risen much faster than prices. By conventional measures, material living standards everywhere
in the income distribution are at all-time highs, and technological progress continues to improve them. Yet
many jobs able to support a family in the past no longer do. Millennials are in worse financial shape than were
those of Generation X at the same age, who themselves had fallen behind the baby boomers.1 The stories appear
irreconcilable.
The explanation is this: inflation does not measure affordability. Key assumptions built in to inflation indexes for
the purpose of measuring the underlying, economy-wide upward pressure on prices are different from, and often
counter to, the key assumptions necessary for assessing the economic choices and constraints faced by households.
When analysts use inflation adjustments to compare household resources over time, they have chosen the
wrong vantage point, and their view is obscured.
Economists and families see three things differently:
Quality Adjustment. Products and services that rise substantially in price but in proportion to measured quality
improvements can become unaffordable, while having no effect on inflation.
Risk-Sharing. New products and services can increase costs for the entire population yet deliver benefits to only a
very small share, while having no effect on inflation.
Social Norms. Society-wide changes in behaviors and expectations can alter the value or necessity of a good or
service, while having no effect on inflation.
As an alternative to inflation adjustment, this paper proposes the development of a “Cost-of-Thriving Index”
(COTI) that tracks the cost of a basket of major items that a family of four would likely seek to buy. A comparison
over time between the cost of that basket and a median weekly wage indicates whether economic trends are
easing or compounding the challenge of making ends meet.
In 1985,2 the COTI stood at 30—it would require 30 weeks of the median weekly wage to afford a three-bedroom
house at the 40th percentile of a local market’s prices, a family health-insurance premium, a semester of public
college, and the operation of a vehicle. By 2018, the COTI had increased to 53—a full-time job was insufficient to
afford these items, let alone the others that a household needs.},

It would ignore quality adjustment: the question is not how great are the things the family does manage to buy." (Cass 2020:37)

(Meng 2018:696)"The use of SRS yardstick also has a deeper reason. The notion of sample size, when used as the sole index of information, is meaningful only when all samples of the same size (from a common population) are probabilistically indistinguishable, that is, when Pr(R{\textbar}N=1 Rj = n) depends only on n and N , which implies SRS." (Meng 2018:696)"in order for the sample average to enjoy the usual n−1 rate for its MSE, we must control its d.d.i. at the rate of N −1, or equivalently the data defect correlation ρR,G at the (stochastic) rate of N −1/2, regardless of the choice of G (as long as σG is finite and fixed)." (Meng 2018:697)"when f is extremely close to one or zero, DI = O(N −1) can be achieved without deliberate probabilistic sampling." (Meng 2018:697)"for probabilistic samples the impact of N on n∗ff (and hence on neff) is canceled out by DI because N DI = O(1" (Meng 2018:698)"once we lose control over the Rmechanism via probabilistic schemes, we can no longer keep the monster N at bay, so to speak. Without the magical power of probabilistic sampling, the righthand side of (3.2), that is, (N − 1)DI , will explode with N . That is, we have a "butterfly effect"—a tiny perturbation caused by DI can lead to catastrophic error in the end for large N , which in turn causes the seemingly incomprehensible loss of effective sample size. It is therefore essentially wishful thinking to rely on the "bigness" of Big Data to protect us from its questionable quality, especially for large populations." (Meng 2018:700)"our false confidence may increase with n, despite the fact that the interval (3.8) has little chance to cover the truth because it is so precisely centered at a wrong location; its width misses a (huge) factor9 of √N − n{\textbar}ρR,G{\textbar}.

(Meng 2018:719)"while weights are inevitable in practice, disclosing weights themselves could jeopardize data confidentiality, especially when the variations in the weights are large" (Meng 2018:719)"those individuals receiving extreme weights, either large or small, may have higher risk of being identified even if their original data are de-identified" (Meng 2018:719)"approximative" (Meng 2018:722)"individualized prediction is about finding a sequence of proxy populations with increased resolutions to learn about an individual. This leads to an ultimate challenge for Statistics (and statisticians): how to build a meaningful theoretical foundation for inference and prediction without any direct data?" (Meng 2018:722)"We can increase the amount of indirect data by matching less on the characteristics that define the target individual, that is, by decreasing the resolution of matching when formulating its proxy populations. But this will decrease the data quality because the resulting proxy populations will be less relevant for the individual and hence their results are likely to be more biased for the target individualized prediction. On the other hand, we can increase the matching resolution and hence obtain more relevant proxy data, but that will necessarily decrease the data quantity and hence increase the variance. Big Data certainly can help to reduce the problem, but they do not escape from this fundamental tradeoff. The paradise for fundamental research is therefore wide open." (Meng 2018:722)},

	abstract = {Although many causal processes have spatial and temporal dimensions, the classical causal inference framework is not directly applicable when the treatment and outcome variables are generated by spatio-temporal point processes. The methodological difficulty primarily arises from the existence of an infinite number of possible treatment and outcome event locations at each point in time. In this paper, we consider a setting where the spatial coordinates of the treatment and outcome events are observed at discrete time periods. We extend the potential outcomes framework by formulating the treatment point process as a stochastic intervention strategy. Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events that would occur in an area of interest under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. We develop an estimation technique by applying the inverse probability of treatment weighting method to the spatially-smoothed outcome surfaces. We show that under a set of assumptions, the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods goes to infinity. Our motivating application is the evaluation of the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. We consider interventions that alter the intensity and target areas of airstrikes. We find that increasing the average number of airstrikes from 1 to 6 per day for seven consecutive days increases all types of insurgent violence.},

Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described.

This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all.

(Shmueli 2010:299)"A common misconception in various scientific fields is that predictive power can be inferred from explanatory power. However, the two are different and should be assessed separately. While predictive power can be assessed for both explanatory and predictive models, explanatory power is not typically possible to assess for predictive models because of the lack ofF and an underlying causal structure.

In addition, we include major armed conflicts resulting in a similarly large death toll. Significant macroeconomic after-effects of the pandemics persist for about 40 years, with real rates of return substantially depressed. In contrast, we find that wars have no such effect, indeed the opposite. This is consistent with the destruction of capital that happens in wars, but not in pandemics. Using more sparse data, we find real wages somewhat elevated following pandemics. The findings are consistent with pandemics inducing labor scarcity and/or a shift to greater precautionary savings.},

We specifically examine whether egalitarian behavior is associated with neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the insular cortex, two regions that have been shown to be related to social preferences. Consistent with previous studies, we find significant activation in both regions; however, only the insular cortex activations are significantly associated with measures of revealed and expressed egalitarian preferences elicited outside the scanner. These results are consistent with the notion that brain mechanisms involved in experiencing the emotional states of others underlie egalitarian behavior in humans.},

We advance this work by distinguishing theoretically a concern for others in general (altruism) from a concern for others in certain groups (social identification). We posit that both concerns generate increased benefits from participation. To test these theories, we use allocations in dictator games towards an unidentified anonymous recipient and two recipients identified only as a registered Democrat or a registered Republican. These allocations permit a distinction between altruism and social identification. The results show that both altruism and social identification significantly increase political participation.

"Subjects are asked a number of standard questions regarding their socioeconomic status, political attitudes, and participation behavior. They then play three "dictator" games (Forsythe et al. 1994), in which they divide a set of lottery tickets between themselves and an anonymous individual. The recipient is completely anonymous in all three games. However, in two of the games, subjects are informed that the recipient is a registered Democrat or a registered Republican. We use these dictator games to uncover the degree to which each subject is generally concerned about the well-being of others, as evidenced by allocations to the unidentified anonymous recipient, and the degree to which each subject socially identifies with the political parties, as shown by allocations to the Democrat and Republican."

"we show that behaviors in these dictator games reveal a key characteristic of social identification: a preference for the ingroup versus the outgroup. Democrats and Republicans both give more to the recipient from their own party than the opposing party; independents give more to the anonymous recipient than the partisan recipients, while partisans do just the opposite. Second, behaviors in these dictator games reveal that strength of social identity magnifies preferences for the ingroup. Subjects who identify themselves as strong Democrats and strong Republicans tend to give much less to the recipient from the opposing party than partisans identifying with weaker affiliations. Third, we uncover a bias against Republicans. The Republican recipient tends to receive less than the Democrat or the unidentified anonymous recipient, even when the donor is a Republican. Finally, both altruism and social identity increase political participation. People who share with an anonymous individual in the dictator game participate in politics more than those who do not share. People who vary the amount they give depending on the partisan affiliation of the recipient also participate more than those who give (or withhold) the same amount to (from) everyone. These results suggest that other-regarding behavior plays an important role in the decision to participate." (Fowler and Kam 2007:814)
"We argue that social identifiers may be spurred into political action when they believe that political outcomes will positively affect members of their group. When individuals perceive political outcomes as distributive—as opportunities to transfer resources from outgroups to their ingroup—social identifiers should be more likely to participate than individuals who are self-interested. Moreover, as people identify more strongly with their ingroup or more strongly against some outgroup, they should experience greater benefits from distributive politics and thus be more likely to participate." (Fowler and Kam 2007:815)
"an innovative measure of altruism and social identity. Previous attempts to examine the relationship between other-regarding behavior and participation have relied on questions in the National Election Study (NES)" (Fowler and Kam 2007:816)
"In contrast, preferences for helping others are revealed in what experimental economists call the "dictator game" (Fowler and Kam 2007:816)

"Andreoni and Miller (2002) address this concern by examining within-subject patterns of choices in their series of dictator games with different payoffs. They find that 98\% of the subjects make choices that are consistent with the general axiom of revealed preferences across eight treatments, suggesting that most of them understand the game and are not choosing randomly." (Fowler and Kam 2007:818)

	abstract = {Summary A new standard is proposed for the evidential assessment of replication studies. The approach combines a specific reverse Bayes technique with prior-predictive tail probabilities to define replication success. The method gives rise to a quantitative measure for replication success, called the sceptical p-value. The sceptical p-value integrates traditional significance of both the original and the replication study with a comparison of the respective effect sizes. It incorporates the uncertainty of both the original and the replication effect estimates and reduces to the ordinary p-value of the replication study if the uncertainty of the original effect estimate is ignored. The framework proposed can also be used to determine the power or the required replication sample size to achieve replication success. Numerical calculations highlight the difficulty of achieving replication success if the evidence from the original study is only suggestive. An application to data from the Open Science Collaboration project on the replicability of psychological science illustrates the methodology proposed.},

In such contexts, it is not uncommon to see sparse or even no overlap between some of the lists on which the estimates are based. These create difficulties in model fitting and selection, and we develop inference procedures to address these challenges. The approach is based on Poisson log-linear regression modeling. Issues investigated in detail include taking proper account of data sparsity in the estimation procedure, as well as the existence and identifiability of maximum likelihood estimates. A stepwise method for choosing the most suitable parameters is developed, together with a bootstrap approach to finding confidence intervals for the total population size. We apply the strategy to two empirical datasets of trafficking in US regions, and find that the approach results in stable, reasonable estimates. An accompanying R software implementation has been made publicly available. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We address this question by examining the consequences of the most deadly pandemic of the last millennium: the Black Death (1347-1351). Our claim is that pandemics can influence politics in the long run if they impose sufficient loss of life so as to augment the price of labor relative to other factors of production. When this occurs, labor repressive regimes (such as serfdom) become untenable, which ultimately leads to the development of proto-democratic institutions and associated political cultures that shape modalities of political engagement for generations. We test our theory by tracing out the local consequences of the Black Death in German-speaking Central Europe. We find that areas hit hardest by the pandemic were more likely to: (1) adopt inclusive political institutions and equitable land ownership patterns; (2)exhibit electoral behavior indicating independence from landed elite influence during the transition to mass politics.},

An established theory in political science holds that Americans’ distrust of government decreases their support for redistribution, but empirical support draws primarily on regression analyses of national surveys. I discuss the untestable assumptions required for identification with regression modeling and propose an alternative design that uses randomized experiments about political corruption to identify the effect of trust in government on support for redistribution under weaker assumptions. I apply this to three survey experiments and estimate the effects that large, experimentally induced increases in political trust have on support for redistribution. Contrary to theoretical predictions, estimated effects are substantively negligible, statistically indistinguishable from zero, and comparable to estimates from two placebo experiments.

We develop a model of the public as a democratic check and evaluate it using two empirical strategies: an original, nationally representative candidate-choice experiment in which some politicians take positions that violate key democratic principles, and a natural experiment that occurred during Montana’s 2017 special election for the U.S. House. Our research design allows us to infer Americans’ willingness to trade-off democratic principles for other valid but potentially conflicting considerations such as political ideology, partisan loyalty, and policy preferences. We find the U.S. public’s viability as a democratic check to be strikingly limited: only a small fraction of Americans prioritize democratic principles in their electoral choices, and their tendency to do so is decreasing in several measures of polarization, including the strength of partisanship, policy extremism, and candidate platform divergence. Our findings echo classic arguments about the importance of political moderation and cross-cutting cleavages for democratic stability and highlight the dangers that polarization represents for democracy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

We corroborate our estimates and extend our analysis using data from a subset of states that share social security numbers, making it easier to quantify who may have voted twice.

Giving the population a role in governance became one means of overcoming the information problem. We test this hypothesis by examining the correlation between localized variation in agricultural suitability and the presence of council governance in the Standard Cross Cultural Sample. As a further step, we suggest that executives facing substantial information asymmetries could also have an alternative route for resource extraction—develop a bureaucracy to measure variation in productivity.

"We reexamine the state boundary-based evidence by documenting the fundamental tradeoff between two sources of bias when using such approaches. Boundary-based approaches require that the areas being compared on either side of the border would experience similar labor market conditions in the absence of a difference in UI duration." (Dieterle et al 2020:85)
"this requires similar industry structure, labor productivity, and agglomeration effects on either side of the border. In the current context, it also means that the economic shocks that triggered UI extensions in one state must evolve over space in such a way that areas on either side of the border are affected similarly. Border-based approaches also require that the effect of the policy is concentrated on one side of the border. If these two conditions hold, then differences in outcomes at state boundaries can be attributed to the longer UI available in one state and not the other. However, there may be a tension between the two conditions since the same factors that make one side of the border an appealing control group for the other—a degree of similarity and labor market connectedness—may also make policy spillovers more likely." (Dieterle et al 2020:85)
"requirement—counties at state borders may be too large to ensure that the measured outcomes would be on average the same across border counties without the policy. This could lead to a discontinuous jump in county-level aggregate outcomes at boundaries even when there are no differences for smaller areas closer to the border." (Dieterle et al 2020:85)
"pproximate the results from a hypothetical regression using more granular data by controlling for the moments of the within-county population distribution relative to the border." (Dieterle et al 2020:86)
"suggestive, but imprecise, evidence that wages and earnings did not change discontinuously at state boundaries." (Dieterle et al 2020:86)
"that workers who live near the border respond to changes in benefits in the neighboring state by shifting employment, not necessarily residence, from the low-benefit state to the high-benefit state. This response is strongest close to the border—within a few kilometers—and fades as you look farther from the border becoming negligible roughly 25 kilometers away." (Dieterle et al 2020:86)
"Together this trade-off suggests that the boundary-based estimation strategies are ill-suited for directly identifying the macro effects of UI extensions on unemployment rates." (Dieterle et al 2020:86)
"realized levels of EB and EUC benefits were determined by state-level labor market indicators passing prespecified trigger levels" (Dieterle et al 2020:87)
"the key endogeneity concern stems from the contemporaneous, transitory shocks that triggered a UI extension for a state at a particular point in time, rather than systematic social, economic, or political factors. Importantly, such contemporaneous factors would not be captured by including fixed effects in a regression." (Dieterle et al 2020:87)
"the BPFE approach tries to control for two types of confounding factors. First to control for contemporaneous shocks that may affect both counties in a pair at a given time—including those that triggered the UI extensions— Hagedorn et al. (2016) regress the difference in labor market s at state borders in a given quarter on the difference in UI benefit duration for each pair. Further differences between county pairs are then controlled for using the interactive effects framework from Bai (2009)." (Dieterle et al 2020:88)

"We find that UI benefits cut the probability of TANF participation by roughly half and have no impact on SNAP and Medicaid." (Leung and O’Leary 2020:160)
"Calibration of the model using observed quantities reveals that for some realistic values of risk aversion, it is socially beneficial to expand UI eligibility, and it is even more so when taking benefit substitution into effect. This finding suggests that policies such as the UI Modernization provisions of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, which allotted \$7 billion to incentivize states to adopt more liberal UI eligibility rules, may have improved the welfare of unemployed workers.1" (Leung and O’Leary 2020:161)},

Moreover, the programs were fragmented and provided only partialinsurance.Also, these were programs designed for working men—for the most part, they didnot cover women.

Bacharach, Peter A. Bamberger, and William J. Sonnenstuhl argue that the decline may have more to do with a crisis of union legitimacy and member commitment. They further suggest that both problems could be addressed if the unions return to their nineteenth-century, mutual aid-based roots.The authors contend that the labor movement is characterized by two models of union-member relations: the mutual aid logic and the servicing logic. The first predominated in the early days and encouraged a sense of community among members who worked to support one another. In the twentieth century, it was largely replaced by the servicing model, which asks little of members, who remain loyal only if their leaders deliver increasing wages and benefits.Regaining legitimacy and strengthening member commitment can only happen, the authors claim, if mutual aid logic is allowed to return. They examine three unions in the transportation industry to judge the effectiveness of new programs created after the old model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {App-based transport has grown rapidly in Indonesia, and now provides work for over a million private commercial drivers. A large proportion of online drivers have joined selforganised community organisations that operate on a mutual aid logic, characterised by horizontal networks and strong social commitment. This mutual aid-based approach, which builds on a long tradition of associational behaviour in Indonesia’s large informal sector, has facilitated high levels of membership and member participation in small, geographically based driver communities. It is less well suited, however, to staging large-scale protests, negotiating with the app-based transport companies or engaging with government. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork, this article argues that mutual aid-based organising has indeed proved an effective way to reach out to this group of non-traditional workers, but is not in itself enough to effect structural change. Ultimately, everyday forms of collectivism must be complemented by large-scale mobilisation, legal challenges and industrial action if drivers are to challenge the power of their pseudo-employers. To date, however, successful integration between driver communities and larger scale organisations has proven difficult in the face of external hostility and internal divisions.},

The two movements also developed in parallel over the course of the two industrial revolutions of 1780-1840 and 1880-1890. Despite this, their paths began increasingly to diverge. Setting out from the same essentially craft-based social milieu as the unions, the mutualist movement gradually took root among the lower-middle and middle classes, the civil service and the military. The mutualist ideology of a common good shared among the social classes was the antithesis of the prevailing ethos in the union movement, of which class struggle was the defining attribute. Finally, the aims of the two movements also diverged: on one hand the trade unionists, engaging in mass and sometimes violent action in support of immediate demands; on the other, the mutualists, working away at their necessarily long-term administrative tasks. From the last quarter of the nineteenth century on, therefore, the mutualist and workers?movements entered into a process of increasing diversification.},

necessitate a more formal, legal structure such as a charitable fund or foundation. To date, no data
has been collected on the scale and scope of employer-provided emergency assistance programs or
their characteristics and best practices. This paper captures 73 responses (53 from web-based survey
and 20 verbal responses) within an estimated universe of 100-125 known funds or foundations. The
key findings are:
 Over 60\% of existing employee relief funds have been created since 2001.
 Most funds are disaster-relief only, since 60\% were created immediately after a disaster and
many employer groups do not wish to comply with IRS requirements for personal hardship
grants.
 Assistance funds, for both disaster relief and personal hardship, typically give out one
disaster grant for every three personal hardship grants.
 Most grants, 80\%, are made to vendors rather than to employees directly.
 Over 60\% of assistance funds are administered by corporate foundations and 70\% have less
than two FTEs managing the program.
 Overall, 20-30\% of employees donate and 70\% of programs offer a matching plan.
 Over 80\% of programs have tax-deductible donations with 73\% of programs reporting taxfree
grants.
 Only 38\% of programs offer on-line donations.
 Every program offers qualified disaster relief, yet only 48\% offer personal-hardship grants.
 Nearly 60\% of application-review decisions are made within one week.
 Average grants are 25-50\% of the program’s maximum grant amount.
 Advisory/Oversight Committees have 4-5 members on average and 57\% meet weekly or as

	abstract = {In addition to its impact on public health, COVID-19 has had a major impact on the economy. To shed light on how COVID-19 is affecting small businesses – and on the likely impact of the recent stimulus bill, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses. Several main themes emerge from the results. First, mass layoffs and closures have already occurred. In our sample, 43 percent of businesses are temporarily closed, and businesses have – on average – reduced their employee counts by 40 percent relative to January. Second, consistent with previous literature, we find that many small businesses are financially fragile. For example, the median business has more than \$10,000 in monthly expenses and less than one month of cash on hand. Third, businesses have widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID related disruptions. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the CARES act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the aid, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility.},

We illustrate the potential of survey sampling and recruitment on Facebook through the example of building a large employee–employer linked data set as part of The Shift Project. We describe the workflow process of targeting, creating, and purchasing survey recruitment advertisements on Facebook. We address concerns about sample selectivity and apply poststratification weighting techniques to adjust for differences between our sample and that of “gold standard” data sources. We then compare univariate and multivariate relationships in the Shift data against the Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Finally, we provide an example of the utility of the firm-level nature of the data by showing how firm-level gender composition is related to wages. We conclude by discussing some important remaining limitations of the Facebook approach, as well as highlighting some unique strengths of the Facebook targeted advertisement approach, including the ability for rapid data collection in response to research opportunities, rich and flexible sample targeting capabilities, and low cost, and we suggest broader applications of this technique.},

	abstract = {The comparative study of advanced capitalist political economies emerged as a distinct subfield of political science in the late 1970s. A number of early contributions to this subfield sought to explain cross-national variation of macroeconomic performance, but the subfield increasingly focused its attention on other issues—the consequences of welfare states, industrial relations, and skill formation for innovation, competition, and the distribution of income—in the 15–20 years prior to the global crisis of 2007–2009. The crisis and its aftermath has ushered in renewed interest in macroeconomic management among comparative political economists. As in the past, this theme is linked to that of interdependence among capitalist economies and the room for partisan differences in macroeconomic policy priorities. In addition, recent contributions to comparative political economy distinguish growth models in terms of the role played by different components of aggregate demand and explore the distributive implications of divergent growth trajectories in countries that have traditionally been conceived as belonging to one or another variety of capitalism.
            With economic growth re-emerging as a central concern in the wake of the crisis, the New Keynesian tradition features prominently in recent efforts to put macroeconomics back into comparative political economy. However, comparative political economists also ought to engage with the Post-Keynesian tradition, which assigns a more important role to policy choices than the New Keynesian tradition. Positing that distributive conflict and power relations are critical to macroeconomic dynamics, the Post-Keynesian tradition provides useful analytical foundations for understanding the political foundations of divergent growth trajectories among advanced capitalist political economies.},

Following literatures on solidarity and fractionalization, race in the U.S. welfare state, and anti-immigrant sentiments, many contend that immigration undermines public support for social policy. This study analyzes three measures of immigration and six welfare attitudes using 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data for 17 affluent democracies. Based on multi-level and two-way fixed-effects models, our results mostly fail to support the generic hypothesis that immigration undermines public support for social policy. The percent foreign born, net migration, and the 10-year change in the percent foreign born all fail to have robust significant negative effects on welfare attitudes. There is evidence that the percent foreign born significantly undermines the welfare attitude that government ?should provide a job for everyone who wants one.? However, there is more robust evidence that net migration and change in percent foreign born have positive effects on welfare attitudes. We conclude that the compensation and chauvinism hypotheses provide greater potential for future research, and we critically consider other ways immigration could undermine the welfare state. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that factors other than immigration are far more important for public support of social policy.},

The results of the descriptive and multilevel analyses support the idea of crosswise crowding-in; in countries where government expenditures in health and social protection are higher, more donors give to support the environment, international aid, and the arts. The level of giving to different sectors, however, is not associated with government expenditures. The results reject the crowding-out hypothesis and provide a nuanced picture of the relationship between government funding and philanthropic giving across different ﬁelds of social welfare.},

With historical reach and statistical and cross-national evidence, The Divided Welfare State demonstrates that private social benefits have not been shaped by public policy, but have deeply influenced the politics of public social programs - to produce a social policy framework whose political and social effects are strikingly different than often assumed. At a time of fierce new debates about social policy, this book is essential to understanding the roots of America's distinctive model and its future possibilities.},

In this article, I provide novel evidence that electoral reforms that shifted from a majoritarian to a proportional system of voter representation generated substantive health benefits for the general population. Using the exemplary case of Switzerland, I first show that the spread of proportional representation between 1890 and 1950 increased political participation and gave the working class, represented by left-wing parties, greater weight in the political process. Consistent with theories of the electoral system, proportional representation increased public investments, esp. in basic education, with few effects on redistribution or total spending. Based on comprehensive archival mortality statistics since 1890, I then demonstrate that the observed shifts in representation and public finances were associated with substantial declines in child mortality by 15\% and in mortality from infectious diseases, the major killer of the time, by 10-15\%.},

While existing research recognizes that households’ ability to privately manage income risk and economic uncertainty influences voter redistributive preferences, we know relatively little about how self-insurance affects evaluations of government in the first place. To gain traction on this question, we combine cross-sectional and panel public opinion surveys from 28 countries in Central Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia with macro-data on economic performance. Exploiting variation in citizen responses to the Great Recession, we show that by enabling citizens to smooth consumption, self-insurance affects how they form economic perceptions. Moreover, we find that self-insurance bolsters support for incumbents. Results allow us to better understand why economic downturns may not dampen support for government, even when economic hardship is rife and access to public safety nets is limited.},

The finding that exposure to inequality begets inequality has fundamental implications for policymakers and informs our understanding of the effects of poverty, inequality, and economic segregation.

	abstract = {Even before the sharp downturn that began in 2007, many Americans were concerned about economic risks. Yet this widespread public concern has not been matched by attention from political scientists regarding how citizens experience and understand the economic risks they face or how those experiences and understandings shape their views of public policy. We develop here an argument about the role of personal economic experiences in the formation of policy attitudes that we validate using a distinctive opinion survey of our own design, fielded not long after the onset of the Great Recession. The survey tracks citizens' economic experiences, expectations, and policy attitudes within multiple domains of risk (employment, medical care, family, and wealth arrangements). These investigations show that economic insecurity systematically and substantially affects citizens' attitudes toward government's role. Citizens' economic worries largely track exposure to substantial economic shocks. Citizens' policy attitudes in turn appear highly responsive to economic worries, as well as to the experience of economic shocks—with worries and shocks creating greater support for government policies that buffer the relevant economic risk. Attitudes seem most affected by temporally proximate shocks, shocks befalling households that have weak private safety nets, and shocks occurring within the domain most relevant to the policy in question, though attitudes are also (more weakly) correlated with shocks in other domains. The magnitude of these associations rivals partisanship and ideology and almost always exceeds that for conventional measures of socio-economic status. Given the long-term increase in economic insecurity and current sluggish recovery, understanding how insecurity shapes citizens' policy attitudes and political behavior should be a major concern of political science.},

"survey of 1,181 likely voters." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:2)
"many Americans do not necessarily connect the need for greater worker power with the need for greater union power. Of respondents who said that workers had too little power, nearly four in ten also said unions had too much power, and another 41\% said that unions had just the right amount of power." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"This was true for both Democrats and Republicans alike." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"careful in messaging and campaign work to distinguish between worker and union power—at least in the abstract" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"Most Americans believe that at-will employment gives employers too much power over their workers. 68\% of respondents disagreed with the statement that employers should be able to fire workers for any reason (including 44\% of respondents who strongly disagreed" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"strong support for just cause termination rights for workers" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"Over 80\% of respondents said it should be illegal for employers to fire workers for protesting health and safety standards, as some employers have done in recent weeks (most notably Amazon)." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:3)
"support for a variety of pro-worker policies, including wage boards, universal strike rights, just cause termination, collective bargaining rights for farm and domestic workers, a right for workers to have a physical space at their workplace where they can discuss issues and problems free from manager supervision, worker representation on corporate boards of directors, and joint management-labor works councils." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:4)
"Over half of respondents agreed with all of these proposals, and there was the strongest support for wage boards (73\% agree, including 39\% strongly agree), a right to a physical space for coworker discussion (71\% agree, including 36\% strongly agree), works councils (71\% agree, including 29\% strongly agree), just cause termination rights (67\% agree, including 38\% strongly agree), and codetermination (65\% agree, including 28\% strongly agree)." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:4)
"labor rights for farm and domestic workers— still garnered 56\% agreement, including 30\% of respondents strongly agreeing" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:4)
"but over half of Republican respondents still agreed with all of the proposed policies polled in the survey" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:4)
"law. Only a quarter of respondents said that they had a friend or family member currently in a union." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:4)
"because such individuals are much more supportive of proposals to boost worker power and organization than individuals without ties to the labor movement, even net of partisanship, ideology, and other demographic characteristics." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:5)
"lives, Americans tended to feel most closely tied to what happens to nurses and health care workers, as well as truck drivers and public-school teachers" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:5)
"They felt least connected to journalists and domestic workers. These perceptions of "linked fate" matter because they are strongly predictive of Americans' support for proworker policies and stronger labor unions." (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:5)
"worker advocates ought to probe ways of identifying Americans' perceptions of linked fate across the workforce and test ways of building this" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:5)
"about half of non-union workers say they would vote for a union at their job. The survey asked employed workers who were not in a union whether they would be willing to vote for a union at their job if an election were held today. 29\% of non-union workers said that they definitely would vote for the union and 26\% said that they would probably vote for the union. About a quarter said that they would probably or definitely vote against the union, and 21\% said that they were not sure" (Hertel-Fernandez 2020:6)},

We evaluate the impact of Community Care Centers: a new crisis response model designed to allay fears about western medical care and, thus, encourage early reporting, isolation, and treatment. We employ new panel data on reported Ebola cases and a difference-in-difference design and find that Community Care Centers dramatically increased reporting, potentially reducing the spread of Ebola. Our results highlight how community-based efforts to increase confidence in health systems can be critical for crisis management.},

(Autor et al 2020:350)"But most of the recent rise in wage inequality has occurred within, rather than between, education groups. The largest part of increased wage variance in the twenty-first century comes from rising inequality among college graduates, with almost no change in wage inequality since 2000 for noncollege workers. Comprehending rising wage inequality in the 2000s requires a better understanding of growing wage inequality among college graduates and of the stagnant earnings of middle-wage workers. The RBET framework remains relevant in the twenty-first century but needs some tweaks." (Autor et al 2020:351)},

By focusing on estimating a specific target of interest (e.g., the average effect of a treatment), rather than on estimating the full underlying data generating distribution, IF-based estimators are often able to achieve asymptotically optimal mean-squared error. Still, many researchers find IF-based estimators to be opaque or overly technical, which makes their use less prevalent and their benefits less available. To help foster understanding and trust in IF-based estimators, we present tangible, visual illustrations of when and how IF-based estimators can outperform standard ``plug-in'' estimators.

	abstract = {Social desirability and the fear of sanctions can deter survey respondents from responding truthfully to sensitive questions. Self-reports on norm breaking behavior such as shoplifting, non-voting, or tax evasion may thus be subject to considerable misreporting. To mitigate such response bias, various indirect question techniques, such as the randomized response technique (RRT), have been proposed. We evaluate the viability of several popular variants of the RRT, including the recently proposed crosswise-model RRT, by comparing respondents’ self-reports on cheating in dice games to actual cheating behavior, thereby distinguishing between false negatives (underreporting) and false positives (overreporting). The study has been implemented as an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 6, 505). Our results from two validation designs indicate that the forced-response RRT and the unrelated-question RRT, as implemented in our survey, fail to reduce the level of misreporting compared to conventional direct questioning. For the crosswise-model RRT we do observe a reduction of false negatives. At the same time, however, there is a non-ignorable increase in false positives; a flaw that previous evaluation studies relying on comparative or aggregate-level validation could not detect.

	abstract = {The idea of moral economy has been increasingly popular in the social sciences over the past decade, given a confusing variety of meanings and sometimes invoked as an empty symbol. This paper begins by describing this state of affairs and some of its undesirable corollaries, which include unthinking invocations of the moral and simplistic views of some sorts of economic activity. Then, referring especially to the work of EP Thompson and James C Scott, this paper proposes a more precise definition of moral economy that roots moral economic activity in the mutual obligations that arise when people transact with each other over the course of time. It thus distinguishes between the moral values that are the context of economic activity and those that arise from the activity itself. The solution that the paper proposes to the confused state of ‘moral economy’ can, therefore, be seen as terminological, as the sub-title suggests, but it is intended to have the substantive benefits of a better approach to economic activity and circulation and a more explicit and thoughtful attention to moral value.},

"It thus distinguishes between the moral values that are the context of economic activity and those that arise from the activity itself. The solution that the paper proposes to the confused state of 'moral economy' can, therefore, be seen as terminological, as the sub-title suggests, but it is intended to have the substantive benefits of a better approach to economic activity and circulation and a more explicit and thoughtful attention to moral value." (Carrier 2018:18)
"anthropologists are prone to forget that neoclassical economics rests on the assumption that people's lives are full of choices of all sorts, and that people make their decisions in a reasonable way given their circumstances." (Carrier 2018:21)
"the substantivist view is concerned with what happens. That is the production of things and their circulation as they move from the point of production to the point of consumption (I use 'things' in the broad sense, to include material objects, labour and services). This is what Polanyi (1957: 243) called 'the means of material want satisfaction', and it takes different forms in different societies. He identified three broad forms of economic circulation, one or another of which may be dominant in any given society: reciprocity, redistribution, exchange." (Carrier 2018:21)
"though, 'moral' can be used descriptively, to refer to any act motivated by a transcendent value that a person holds," (Carrier 2018:22)
"is moral, in two ways (see generally Fourcade and Healy, 2007: 286-291). Firstly, because the market is relatively free, it allows people to make their own decisions about what will make their lives better, rather than having those decisions made for them by others. Secondly, such a system, and especially the drive for increased profit that is part of it, encourages the efficient use of resources, which means that people generally will have lives that are more comfortabl" (Carrier 2018:23)
"from material want are unworthy goals or that they are not moral. The common uses of 'moral' that I have mentioned have two features worth noting. Firstly, those uses often relate only to the act and the transcendence of the value that motivates it, and do not identify the content of that value. All that they require is that a person think that something is good, and by extension is motivated to act in ways that express that good or that help to bring it about or protect it from threat. Secondly, at least in common usage, calling an act moral tends to justify it, in two ways. It indicates that it is motivated by a transcendent value rather than being narrowly self-serving and often it implies that the value is one shared by those using the term." (Carrier 2018:23)
"economic morality (which is different from the definition of moral economy" (Carrier 2018:23)
"closer to Thompson's and Scott's use of the term than are the ones I have described. That meaning refers not to values but to obligations, those that arise from interactions between people." (Carrier 2018:23)
"difficult to imagine such activity as not being so shaped). This led Chris Hann to urge that we not use 'moral economy' in that way. Rather, he (2016: 13) says that 'we do better to speak of a moral dimension, an ethical context of economic activity'." (Carrier 2018:24)
"James Zetka (1992)" (Carrier 2018:27)
"However, there are some tasks that require the co-operation of workers, and Zetka found that those engaged in such tasks were significantly more likely to support their fellow workers in wildcat strikes" (Carrier 2018:27)
"moral economic activity occurs in and helps to reproduce relationships in which the transactors have become obligated to each other because of their past transactions. This means that such activity is motivated to a significant degree by the relationship in which it occurs. On the other hand, in its pure form neoclassical economic activity occurs between transactors who are indifferent to each other and concerned only with the objects transacted" (Carrier 2018:30)
"A moral economy is an economy or a part of one in which moral economic activity predominates, w" (Carrier 2018:30)
"A neoclassical economy is one in which neoclassical economic activity predominates," (Carrier 2018:30)
"directs our attention to the activities that are fundamental to life everywhere, those by which people secure their substance. As well, the way that I have approached 'moral' shifts our focus away from individuals and their values. Instead, it points to the possibility that, when people engage in economic transactions with others, those transactions can generate a relationship with those others and an obligation to transact again in the future. In other words, it encourages us to look at economic transactions in terms of relationships and their histories. Finally, this definition allows us to see some economies and some realms of life as more or less moral, depending upon the degree to which moral economic activity is predominant in them."

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classiﬁcation rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik’s support vector classiﬁers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14497},
	abstract = {Heterogeneous eﬀect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment eﬀects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give suﬃcient conditions for oracle eﬃciency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle eﬃcient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some ﬁnite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},

Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2,3,4,5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

While several single-country studies point to the existence of this relationship, the link between electoral cycles and credit expansion has seen little exploration at the multicountry level. Using a comprehensive dataset covering bank and non-bank credit in 165 countries from 1960 to 2013, we show that both government and private credit significantly increase in election years. This finding suggests the possibility that politicians use not only fiscal and monetary policy to court voters, but also implement credit policies such as interest rate subsidies and tax breaks for debt to enhance credit growth. We also find that a higher degree of financial openness weakens the frequency and magnitude of political credit cycles; yet, the conditional effect of financial openness is stronger for developing countries than developed economies.},

	abstract = {The growth of American governments in the twentieth century included large increases in funds for social insurance and public assistance. Social insurance has increased far more than public assistance, so “rise in the social insurance state” is a far better description of the century than “rise in the welfare state.” The United States has increased total spending in these areas as much or more as have European countries, but the U.S. spending has relied less heavily on government programs. In the U.S. states largely determine the benefits for many of the public assistance and social insurance programs, leading to large variation in the benefits across the country. I develop estimates of these benefits across time and place and compare them to the poverty line, manufacturing earnings and benefits, state per capita incomes in the US, as well as GDP per capita in countries throughout the world.},

First, what many people call the rise in the welfare state in the United States might better be described as the "Rise of the Social Insurance State." "Rise of the Welfare State" could be seen as a rise in public assistance transfers to the poor. Yet, such transfers have not been very large relative to gross domestic product (GDP). A very large share of the expansion in social welfare spending has come from social insurance that covers people throughout the income distribution. The social insurance programs were much easier to sell politically and carried much less social stigma because participants felt that they or their employers had paid for their benefits up front."

A survey of the perceptions of young economists supports the formal statistical analysis. Pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists. However, the T5 screen is far from reliable. A substantial share of influential publications appear in non-T5 outlets. Reliance on the T5 to screen talent incentivizes careerism over creativity.( JEL A14, I23, J44, J62)},

Given that the issue—joining the European Union—was a major institutional change, a referendum in this context made sense. Using a " nonbinding" referendum that was nonetheless viewed as binding without clear rules for repeal or future referenda was not a good innovation. That referendum was about a specific issue and passed by a two-third majority. It is now interpreted as making legitimate referenda over unclear but dramatic institutional changes that are taken as binding if passed even by a slender majority.

Citizens do not observe the leader's type but infer it from signals in their living standards, state propaganda, and messages sent by an informed elite via independent media. If citizens conclude that the leader is incompetent, they overthrow him. The dictator can invest in making convincing state propaganda, censoring independent media, co-opting the elite, or equipping police to repress attempted uprisings—but he must finance such spending at the expense of the public's consumption. We show that informational autocracies prevail over old-style, overtly violent dictatorships when the informed elite is sufficiently large but are replaced by democracies when elites are too numerous to be bribed or censored. The theory provides insight into various soft authoritarian regimes around the world and suggests a logic of modernization behind recent global political trends.},

To test the method, we used Facebook advertisements to quota sample 2432 US respondents for a survey on climate change public opinion. We conducted a contemporaneous nationally representative survey asking identical questions using a high-quality online survey panel whose respondents were recruited using probability sampling. Many results from the Facebook-sampled survey are similar to those from the online panel survey; furthermore, results from the Facebook-sampled survey approximate results from the American Community Survey (ACS) for a set of validation questions.

Even within countries, people across the political spectrum are said to be in remarkable agreement about the ideal level of economic inequality. Using survey data from 40 countries and a novel survey experiment in the United States, we show that this apparent agreement is illusory. When relying on a widely used cross-national survey measure of Ideal Pay Ratios, preferred levels of inequality are heavily influenced by two well-documented sources of perceptual distortion: the anchoring effect and ratio bias. These effects are substantial and many times larger than the influence of fundamental political predispositions. As a result, these cross-national survey measures tapping preferences regarding economic inequality produce misleading conclusions about desired levels of inequality.},

In theory, it inequitably favors the proposer, and paradoxically, it disadvantages voters further if they are inequity averse. In practice, however, outcomes are equitable. The present paper analyzes data from a novel experimental design to identify the underlying social preferences. Our experiment compares one-shot and indefinite horizon versions of random-proposer majority bargaining (the Baron-Ferejohn game) which allow us to disentangle behaviors compatible with altruism, inequity aversion, and reference dependent altruism. Most subjects are classified as reference-dependent altruists, around 10\% are inequity averse. Subjects are egoistic when their payoff is below their reference point, they become efficiency concerned when satisfied, and the reference point is either the ex ante expectation or the opponent's payoff. Finally, we successfully test RDA out-of-sample on a number of distribution and bargaining games from three seminal social preference experiments.},

	abstract = {This study provides a unified framework to compare three canonical types of contests: winner-take-all contests won by the best performer, winner-take-all lotteries where probability of success is proportional to performance, and proportional-prize contests in which rewards are shared in proportion to performance. We derive equilibria and observe outcomes from each contest in a laboratory experiment. Equilibrium and observed efforts are highest in winner-take-all contests. Lotteries and proportional-prize contests have the same Nash equilibrium, but empirically, lotteries induce higher efforts and lower, more unequal payoffs. Behavioral deviations from theoretical benchmarks in different contests are caused by the same underlying attributes, such as risk-aversion and the utility of winning. Finally, we find that subjects exhibit consistent behavior across different types of contests, with subjects exerting higher effort in one contest also exerting higher effort in another contest.},

The entitlement effect is at the core of experimental Public Choice – not just because it concerns the topics of bargaining and negotiations, but also because it relates to the question about under which circumstances actors behave more rational. We conduct three experiments, two in the laboratory and one online, with more than 1,250 participants. Our original motivation was to study gender differences, but ultimately we could not replicate the entitlement effect in the Ultimatum Game in any of our three experiments.

	abstract = {According to Alesina and Angeletos (2005), societies are less redistributive but more efficient when the median voter believes that effort and talent are much more important than luck in determining income. We test these results through a lab experiment in which participants vote over the tax rate and their pre-tax income is determined according to their performance in a real-effort task with leisure time. Subjects receive either a high or a low wage and this condition is either obtained through their talent in a tournament or randomly assigned. We compare subjects' decisions in these two different scenarios, taking into consideration different levels of wage inequality. In our framework, this initial income inequality turns out to be crucial to support the theoretical hypothesis of Alesina and Angeletos (2005). Overall, we find that, only if the wage inequality is high, subjects choose a lower level of income redistribution and provide a higher effort level in the scenario in which high-wage subjects are selected based on their talent through a tournament (than when it is randomly assigned). Thus, we confirm almost all theoretical results in Alesina and Angeletos (2005) when the wage inequality is high enough. The big exception is for efficiency (measured as the sum of total payoffs), since theoretical results are not significant for both wage inequality scenarios.},

	abstract = {One of the important topics in public choice is how people's free-riding behavior could differ by group size in collective action dilemmas. This paper experimentally studies how the strength of third party punishment in a prisoner's dilemma could differ by the number of third parties in a group. Our data indicate that as the number of third party punishers increases in a group, the average punishment intensity per third party punisher decreases. However, the decrease rate is very mild and therefore the size of total punishment in a group substantially increases with an increase in group size. As a result, third party punishment becomes a sufficient deterrent against a player selecting defection in the prisoner's dilemma when the number of third party punishers is sufficiently large. Nevertheless, when there are too many third party punishers in a group, a defector's expected payoff is far lower than that of a cooperator due to strong aggregate punishment, while some cooperators are even hurt through punishment. Therefore, the group incurs a huge efficiency loss. Such over-punishment results from third party punishers’ conditional punishment behaviors: their punishment intensity is positively correlated with their beliefs on the peers’ punitive actions. Some possible ways to coordinate punishment among peers even when group size is very large, thus enabling the efficiency loss to be mitigated, are also discussed in the paper.},

The fraction of workers reporting positive values declines with unemployment, while time spent in non-work conditional on any such time rises with unemployment.

We find that a 1 percentage point reduction in the local unemployment rate is associated with a roughly 0.27 percentage point reduction in the fraction of jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree and a roughly 0.23 percentage point reduction in the fraction requiring five or more years of experience. This pattern is established using multiple measures of labor availability, is bolstered by similar trends along heretofore un-measured dimensions of skill, and even occurs within firm–job title pairs. We further confirm the causal effect of labor market tightening on skill requirements using a natural experiment based on the fracking boom in the United States, as an exogenous shock to the local labor supply in tradable, non-fracking industries. These industries are not plausibly affected by local demand shocks or natural gas extraction technology, but still show fewer skill requirements in response to tighter labor markets. Our results imply this labor market-induced downskilling reversed much of the cyclical increase in education and experience requirements that occurred during the Great Recession.},

This paper examines two recent studies that make use of regression discontinuity to discuss evident practical problems with these estimates and how they interact with pathologies of the current system of scientific publication. First, we discuss a recent study that estimates the effect on air pollution and life expectancy of a coal-heating policy in China. The reported effects, based on a thirddegree polynomial, are statistically significant but substantively dubious, and are sensitive to model choice. This study is indicative of a category of policy analyses where strong claims are based on weak data and methodologies which permit the researcher wide latitude in presenting estimated treatment effects. We then replicate a procedure from Green et al., in which regression discontinuity is used to recover estimated treatment effects relative to an experimental benchmark, to illustrate one practical problem with the regression discontinuity estimates in the coal-heating paper: high-degree polynomials yield noisy estimates of treatment effects that do not accurately convey uncertainty. We recommend that (a) researchers consider the problems which may result from controlling for higher-order polynomials; and (b) that journals recognize that quantitative analyses of policy issues are often inconclusive and relax the implicit rule under which statistical significance is a condition for publication.},

"(Gelman and Imbens, 2014) we present evidence that controlling for high-order polynomials in RD analysis results in noisy estimates with poor statistical properties and confidence intervals that are too narrow." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556983)
"with five other methods used for causal inference in observational studies: simple regression, matching, selection modeling, difference in differences, and instrumental variables." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556984)
"in practice causal analyses often seem to flow from identification opportunities to inferences of interest (Gelman, 2009), a view that contrasts with the usual textbook presentation in which the research question comes first and then the analyst finds an identification strategy to attack the problem at hand" (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556984)
"low bias has no practical meaning in the presence of high variance, and second because datasets are typically constructed by pooling over different subpopulations or different time periods or different sorts of cases, so that any claims of unbiased estimates typically apply only to aggregates that are not directly relevant to the ultimate questions of interest." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556984)
"we would prefer a spline or Gaussian process or some other such smooth model, as indeed has been suggested, for example, by Calonico et al., 2014" (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556984)
"these results are interesting even if the 95\% CIs happen to include zero." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556984)
"do not include other predictors and that the residual errors are large" (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556985)
"neither the linear nor the cubic nor any other polynomial model is appropriate here. Instead, there are other variables not included in the model which distinguish the circles in the graph" (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556986)
"high-degree polynomials produce noisy estimated treatment effects with standard errors that do not accurately reflect the true degree of uncertainty in the estimate." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556986)
"RD inferences can have much worse than nominal coverage (for example, p-values of 0.05 occurring more than 10\% of the time) in the presence of systematic error in the fitted curve" (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556986)
"without some constraint on the smoothness of the fitted functions, we do not recommend simply fitting such a model. Including highorder polynomials is not a universally conservative approach. These models can fail, generating noisy estimated discontinuity coefficients with p-values that do not reflect the uncertainty of the model specification." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556987)
"authors retreat from strongly model-based claims of statistical significance and that journals accept that nonstatistically-significant findings on important topics are still worth publishing." (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556987)
"much of the estimated discontinuity arises from the steep gradient estimated in life expectancy with latitude near the discontinuity," (Gelman and Zelizer 2015:205316801556987)
"What we are warning against is the appealing but misguided view that users can correct for arbitrary dependence on the forcing variable by simply including several polynomial terms in a regression. We recommend that any RD analysis include a plot such as Figure 1 showing data and the fitted model, and that users be wary of any resulting inferences based on fits that don't make substantive sense."

	abstract = {Wealth is highly correlated between parents and their children; however, little is known about the extent to which these relationships are genetic or determined by environmental factors. We use administrative data on the net wealth of a large sample of Swedish adoptees merged with similar information for their biological and adoptive parents. Comparing the relationship between the wealth of adopted and biological parents and that of the adopted child, we ﬁnd that, even prior to any inheritance, there is a substantial role for environment and a much smaller role for pre-birth factors and we ﬁnd little evidence that nature/nurture interactions are important. When bequests are taken into account, the role of adoptive parental wealth becomes much stronger. Our ﬁndings suggest that wealth transmission is not primarily because children from wealthier families are inherently more talented or more able but that, even in relatively egalitarian Sweden, wealth begets wealth. We further build on the existing literature by providing a more comprehensive view of the role of nature and nurture on intergenerational mobility, looking at a wide range of different outcomes using a common sample and method. We ﬁnd that environmental inﬂuences are relatively more important for wealth-related variables such as savings and investment decisions than for human capital. We conclude by studying consumption as an overall measure of welfare and ﬁnd that, like wealth, it is more determined by environment than by biology.},

This suggests that wealth transmission is primarily due to environmental factors rather than because children of wealthy parents are inherently more talented.

In 2000, the tax rate was 1.5\% on net household wealth exceeding SEK 900,000. The Swedish krona traded at \$0.106 at the end of 2000, so this threshold corresponds to \$95,400. After 2000, the tax threshold was raised to SEK 1,500,000 for married couples and non-married cohabitating couples with common children and 1,000,000 for single taxpayers. In 2002, the threshold rose again, this time to SEK 2,000,000 for married couples and non-married cohabitating couples and 1,500,000 for single taxpayers. In 2005, the threshold rose once more but only for married couples and cohabitating couples, this time to SEK 3,000,000. Because the wealth tax was repealed in 2006, data for 2007 are not considered reliable; as a result, we limit our analysis to 1999-2006."

The adoptive parents have to be married and be at least 25 years old, have appropriate housing, and be free of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. The adoptive father was required to have a steady income and the adoptive mother was expected to be able to stay home with the child for a certain period of time.23 Overall, the adoption criteria meant that the adoptive parents were positively selected relative to the general population."

Scholarly accounts commonly distinguish between structural sources of business power, connected to its privileged position in capitalist economies, and instrumental sources, related to direct forms of lobbying by business actors. The authors argue that this distinction overlooks an important third source of business power, which they conceptualize as institutional business power. Institutional business power results when state actors delegate public functions to private business actors. Over time, through policy feedback and lock-in effects, institutional business power contributes to an asymmetrical dependence of the state on the continued commitment of private business actors. This article elaborates the theoretical argument behind this claim, providing empirical examples of growing institutional business power in education in Germany, Sweden, and the United States.},

The authors seek to understand this variation and in doing so make three contributions: First, they conceptualize communities and individuals as networks more or less capable of demanding high-quality policing. Second, they present original survey data and semistructured interviews on local policing from over one hundred sixty slums, eight thousand households, and one hundred seventy informal neighborhood leaders in India that contribute to the nascent empirical work on comparative policing and order. Third, they find evidence that well-connected individuals and densely connected neighborhoods express greater confidence in and satisfaction with local policing. Critically, these differences do not appear to be a function of a lower propensity for local conflict but rather of an increased capacity to leverage neighborhood leaders to mediate relations with the police. The combination of analytics and empirics in this article provides insight into the conditions under which individuals and communities experience the police as expropriators of rents or neutral providers of order.},

Using novel shipment-level data from U.S. customs declarations, we generate a set of firms that were “eligible” to join these remediation initiatives. We are able to positively attribute only a minority of US RMG imports from Bangladesh to Accord and Alliance signatories. Firms with consumer-facing brands, publicly-traded firms, and those importing more RMG product from Bangladesh were more likely to sign up for the Accord and Alliance. Firms headquartered in the USA were much less likely to sign onto remediation plans, especially the Accord.},

A recent wave of scholarship has highlighted an acute degree of political inequality in contemporary democracies in North America and Europe. In contrast to the view that unequal responsiveness in favor of the affluent is nearly inevitable when income inequality is high, we argue that organized labor can be an effective source of political equality. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the U.S. House of Representatives, our novel dataset combines income-specific estimates of constituency preferences based on 223,000 survey respondents matched to roll-call votes with a measure of district-level union strength drawn from administrative records. We find that local unions significantly dampen unequal responsiveness to high incomes: a standard deviation increase in union membership increases legislative responsiveness towards the poor by about six to eight percentage points. As a result, in districts with relatively strong unions legislators are about equally responsive to rich and poor Americans. We rule out alternative explanations using flexible controls for policies, institutions, and economic structure, as well as a novel instrumental variable for unionization based on history and geography. We also show that the impact of unions operates via campaign contributions and partisan selection.},

We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central locations.

Many of the limitations of such samples are well-known, but the issue of statistical dependence due to social network ties has not previously been addressed. We show that, along with anticonservative variance estimation, this can result in spurious associations due to network dependence. Using a statistical test that we adapted from one developed for spatial autocorrelation, we test for network dependence in several of the thousands of influential papers that have been published using FHS data. Results suggest that some of the many decades of research on coronary heart disease, other health outcomes, and peer influence using FHS data may suffer from spurious associations, error-prone point estimates, and anticonservative inference due to unacknowledged network dependence. These issues are not unique to the FHS; as researchers in psychology, medicine, and beyond grapple with replication failures, this unacknowledged source of invalid statistical inference should be part of the conversation.

"outcome, spurious associations due to dependence are unrelated to the causal relationships among the exposure, outcome, and other variables. Although this phenomenon is well-known in the econometrics literature on time series, it has never, to our knowledge, been addressed in a general dependent data framework. We focus primarily on network dependence, but spurious associations due to dependence can arise no matter the source of dependence across observations-be it spatial, genetic, network, temporal, or other." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:2)
"Our results suggest that the i.i.d. assumption on which thousands of FHS papers have relied does not consistently hold, and therefore that spurious associations due to network dependence may be widespread among studies using FHS data, and likely beyond." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:2)
"on modeling away the dependence within the variables of interest before assessing the association between them." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:3)
"Informally and heuristically, spurious associations due to dependence can arise whenever the similarity between X values for two observations, e.g. jXi Xj j, predicts C ov(Xi ; Xj ), which in turn predicts C ov(Yi ; Yj ) and jYi Yj j. The crucial step is the relationship between C ov(Xi ; Xj ) and C ov(Yi ; Yj ); this holds whenX andY have similar variance-covariances matrices." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:5)
"It will generally not arise, however, whenever data are clustered, with dependence within but not between clusters." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:5)

We verified in simulations that the power of Moran's I to detect dependence tends to increase with increasing dependence (see Section 6)." (Lee and Ogburn 2020:13)

"Even if we knew that inference under approximate normality were licensed, finding a good standard error estimator, e.g. one that is consistent with the same rate of convergence as the parameter of interest, remains an open challenge in most settings. If researchers have full knowledge of network structure and of the geodesic distance at which dependence becomes negligible, then it is relatively straightforward to estimate the variance of a sample mean or an M-estimator, because it is clear which of the covariance terms in var( ) = Pi var(Yi ) + Pi6=j cov(Yi ; Yj ) can be a priori set to 0" (Lee and Ogburn 2020:25)

We propose an inexpensive and feasible strategy for network elicitation using Aggregated Relational Data (ARD): responses to questions of the form “how many of your links have trait k ?” Our method uses ARD to recover parameters of a network formation model, which permits sampling from a distribution over node- or graph-level statistics. We replicate the results of two field experiments that used network data and draw similar conclusions with ARD alone. (JEL C81, C93, D85, Z13)},

"budget. We propose that researchers collect research scalable and accessible on a e responses to questions of the form: Think of all of the households in your village with whom you «INSERT ACTIVITY». How many of these have trait k ?" (Breza et al 2020:2455)
"Our proposed method is intuitive and comes down to the following three simple observations. First, ARD is considerably cheaper and easier to collect than network data. Second, ARD provides the researcher with enough information to identify parameters of an oft-used and standard network formation model in the statistics literature (see, e.g., Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock 2002). The argument builds on prior hich shows how the network formation pends only on ARD. We describe this and present an identification argument. We prove consistency of the estimation of the model parameters in Breza et al. (2020a)." (Breza et al 2020:2455)
"we consider settings where we have ARD for a randomly selected subset of nodes in the network and a basic vector of covariates for the full set of nodes." (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"ARD counts the number of links an agent has to members of different subgroups in the population. The core insight of our approach is that by combining ARD with a network formation model, we can derive the posterior distribution for the graph. To do this, we assume a network formation model, which we refer to as the latent distance model, where the probability of a connection depends on individual heterogeneity and the positions of nodes in a latent social space (Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock 2002)" (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"ARD gives us information on where different subgroups lie relative to one another in this latent space. That is, ARD allows us to triangulate the relative locations of nodes. In prior work, McCormick and Zheng (2015) shows how to relate the network formation model RD. We extend that result and show how" (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"location of all nodes in the latent-space." (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"equipped with estimates of the degree distribution as well as the latent space locations in the ARD sample, we can use the demographic covariates for the entire sample to estimate the posterior distributions of the degrees, fixed effects, and latent locations for the entire population. We can then generate graphs from the posterior distribution over formation model parameters given the ARD response vector and compute network statistics for each generated graph." (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"Our approach is parametric, relying on guessing the network structure through the pseudo-true parameters of the latent distance formation model estimated from" (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"ARD. It can do no better than the best latent distance model at capturing the likely distribution that generated the network." (Breza et al 2020:2456)
"7 Note that this gives a direct estimate of the respondent's degree. The method laid out in Section II does not degree based on the ARD responses alone." (Breza et al 2020:2459)
"(iii) Estimate Network Formation Model with ARD: Use the information from counts from the census to estimate the del. In this model, the probability that nds on household fixed effects ( ν ), and cations z ) with distance ( z z ) ) X in the ARD sample.but not in the ARD cts and latent locations for all n households network g being drawn is fully com-n" (Breza et al 2020:2460)
"i id number of nodes of type k known by i is roughly its expected degree scaled by the population share of the group, adjusted by a factor that captures the relative proximity of the node to the type in question in latent-space. Note that, in the expression above, both the distance between an individual and the center of the latent trait distributions as well as the concentration of the latent trait distribution influence the (expected) number of individuals know" (Breza et al 2020:2462)
"These may be quite poor in practice, though it is difficult to derive the finite sample distribution. Nonetheless, what this suggests is that in cases where the network is too sparse, the ARD approach may be uninformative, and the researcher will see this plainly. This is the case for two reasons. First, by definition, anyone in the ARD sample will know fewer alters with trait k since the network has fewer links on average. Second, there will be too much variation in our location estimates and degree estimates, which then will also affect our node heterogeneity estimates. This means that when the researcher faces rather diffuse posteriors, the network may be too sparse to convey much information." (Breza et al 2020:2468)

Considering union membership as an on/off switch (member vs. non-member), as it is often done, it is only possible to distinguish between a selection effect (unions attract like-minded individuals) and a molding effect (the experience of membership has a transformational impact on the individual). Exploiting the longitudinal structure of the data reveals that union membership is best characterized not as a switch, but as a dynamic process involving anticipation effects (which start well before becoming affiliated) and maturation effects (which become noticeable only after a certain duration of membership and may not dissipate after leaving the union). Empirically, the selection effect appears the most important in the two countries we focus on, while the molding effect is less pronounced. Anticipation and maturation effects are also non-negligible and hitherto unexplored.},

It is hypothesized that if information about the existing screening mechanisms is highlighted and made salient, this will lead to greater approval of eligibility-based programs. This expectation is evaluated using a survey experiment that explores administrative burden in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The evidence shows that being exposed to information about administrative burden increases favorability toward TANF and its recipients, though these effects are conditional on party identification. The results provide insight into a potential consequence of administrative burden, showing the way in which information regarding burden can shape citizens’ support for eligibility-based programs.},

	abstract = {Despite increased interest across a range of scientific applications in modeling and understanding social network structure, collecting complete network data remains logistically and financially challenging, especially in the social sciences. This article introduces a latent surface representation of social network structure for partially observed network data. We derive a multivariate measure of expected (latent) distance between an observed actor and unobserved actors with given features. We also draw novel parallels between our work and dependent data in spatial and ecological statistics. We demonstrate the contribution of our model using a random digit-dial telephone survey and a multiyear prospective study of the relationship between network structure and the spread of infectious disease. The model proposed here is related to previous network models which represents high-dimensional structure through a projection to a low-dimensional latent geometric surface-encoding dependence as distance in the space. We develop a latent surface model for cases when complete network data are unavailable. We focus specifically on aggregated relational data (ARD) which measure network structure indirectly by asking respondents how many connections they have with members of a certain subpopulation (e.g., How many individuals do you know who are HIV positive?) and are easily added to existing surveys. Instead of conditioning on the (latent) distance between two members of the network, the latent surface model for ARD conditions on the expected distance between a survey respondent and the center of a subpopulation on a latent manifold surface. A spherical latent surface and angular distance across the sphere’s surface facilitate tractable computation of this expectation. This model estimates relative homogeneity between groups in the population and variation in the propensity for interaction between respondents and group members. The model also estimates features of groups which are difficult to reach using standard surveys (e.g., the homeless). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Empirically, we use new measures capturing various Weberian features in countries across the world, with some time series extending back to 1789. The evidence base from previous large-N studies is surprisingly thin, but our extensive data enable us to move beyond the problematic cross-country correlations used in previous studies. Hence, we conduct tests that control for country-specific characteristics while ensuring sufficient variation on the slow-moving bureaucracy variables to enable precise estimation. Our analysis suggests that previous cross-country regressions have vastly overstated the strength of the relationship. While this casts uncertainty on the proposition that there is an effect of Weberian bureaucracy on growth, our further analysis suggests that—if an effect exists—it may operate in the short term and be stronger in recent decades.},

We study this question using conjoint experimental techniques on a nationally representative sample of Americans. This design allows us to vary a large number of features of the workplace--especially their governance structures and the degree to which these structures allow for meaningful democratic decision-making. We hypothesize that workers should have a preference for democratic corporate governance structures such as employee ownership, co-determination, and the direct election of management. We find strong support that Americans have a preference for workplace democratization and that the magnitude is economically significant. Overall, this article marshals new data and analyses to better understand public preferences over "corporate regime type."},

In "A Preface To Economic Democracy" and other writings over the past two decades, Robert Dahl has developed a neo-Kantian proof for the existence of such a right. Even if we accept the norm of distributive justice upon which Dahl founds his proof, voluntary subjection to authoritarian power in firms does not violate the legitimate entitlements of employees. While adult residents of territorial associations do possess a moral right to political equality, polities and firms are qualitatively different types of associations in which the entitlements of subjects are distinct. Subjection to power is acquired in different ways in the two kinds of associations, and this difference deprives employees-but not residents-of a right to democratic voice as a matter of moral desert.},

Using a local labour markets design, we estimate that manufacturing decline significantly reduced employment between 2000 and 2006, while local housing booms increased employment. These results suggest that housing booms ‘masked’ employment declines that would have occurred earlier in the absence of the booms. This ‘masking’ occurred both within and between cities and demographic groups. We find that roughly 40\% of the reduction in employment during the 2000s can be attributed to manufacturing decline and that these negative effects would have appeared earlier had it not been for the large, temporary increases in housing demand.},

I use 127 survey items to measure six potential bases of these and other antidemocratic sentiments: partisan affect, enthusiasm for President Trump, political cynicism, economic conservatism, cultural conservatism, and ethnic antagonism. The strongest predictor by far, for the Republican rank-and-file as a whole and for a variety of subgroups defined by education, locale, sex, and political attitudes, is ethnic antagonism—especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos. The corrosive impact of ethnic antagonism on Republicans’ commitment to democracy underlines the significance of ethnic conflict in contemporary US politics.},

I argue that career politicians are more likely to adopt policies for strategic political reasons, whereas working-class politicians are more likely to represent the interests of working-class voters. Changes in the representation of these occupational groups matter substantively whenever legislators’ strategic concerns contradict the interests of working-class voters. Welfare reforms adopted in the 1990s and 2000s by the British Labour Party exhibit this divergence. The two types of politicians held very different policy positions, which I measure using a scaling method applied to all speeches made about welfare in the House of Commons from 1987 to 2007. The results carry over to voting behavior and are robust to alternative explanations, including other characteristics of both MPs and their voters. The changing representation of occupational groups has therefore had substantive policy effects, lowering the political influence of working-class voters.},

This concerns the problem of reading history backward rather than forward. To understand this problem, we need to embed it in broader methodological discussions of how the selection of evidence is shaped (and potentially biased) by all sorts of prior assumptions going into the evidence-collection process. Thus, reading history backward makes scholars refrain from posing certain questions, become blind to certain descriptive developments and explanatory factors, and fail to enlist certain historical data. This article pulls together the fragmentary insights about this problem and devises an alternative, prospective approach centered on an open reading of the work of historians. Although this is a “low-tech” issue, it is one that has huge ramifications for the way we do historical analysis as political scientists.},

These diagrams can be reinterpreted as probability models, enabling use of graph theory in probabilistic inference, and allowing easy deduction of independence conditions implied by the assumptions. They can also be used as a formal tool for causal inference, such as predicting the eﬀects of external interventions. Given that the diagram is correct, one can see whether the causal eﬀects of interest (target eﬀects or causal estimands) can be estimated from available data, or what additional observations are needed to validly estimate those eﬀects. One can also see how to represent the eﬀects as familiar standardized eﬀect measures. This article gives an overview of the following: (i) components of causal graph theory; (ii) probability interpretations of graphical models; and (iii) methodological implications of the causal and probability structures encoded in the graph, such as sources of bias and the data needed for their control.},

	abstract = {In 2015, approximately 244 million people were transnational migrants, approximately half of whom were workers, often engaged in jobs that are hazardous to their health. They work for less pay, for longer hours, and in worse conditions than do nonmigrants and are often subject to human rights violations, abuse, human trafﬁcking, and violence. Worldwide, immigrant workers have higher rates of adverse occupational exposures and working conditions, which lead to poor health outcomes, workplace injuries, and occupational fatalities. Health disparities of immigrant workers are related to environmental and occupational exposures and are a result of language/cultural barriers, access to health care, documentation status, and the political climate of the host country. Recommendations on global and local scales are offered as potential solutions to improving the health of immigrant workers.},

This article surveys literature from a wide array of regulatory domains—antidiscrimination, environmental protection, product quality, corporate governance, law enforcement, tax compliance, minimum wage and overtime protection, and occupational safety and health—in an effort to identify common ﬁndings on what unions do for regulation. Literature on the topic has taken up ﬁve questions: how labor unions affect the passage of protective laws and regulations; how they affect the outcomes that regulators target; how they affect the intensity of regulatory enforcement; the speciﬁc activities and channels of inﬂuence they use to inﬂuence regulated outcomes; and the role they play in self-regulation. Drawing on empirical literature from the domains listed, I review and analyze literature on each of these questions and offer several conclusions and suggestions for future research.},

Formal statistical models for the analysis of network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation. Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an active “social science network community” and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past decade has seen a burgeoning network literature coming out of statistical physics and computer science. In particular, the growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online “networking communities” such as Facebook, Google+, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Twitter, and a host of more specialized professional network communities have intensified interest in the study of networks and network data. This article reviews some of these developments, introduces some relevant statistical models for static network settings, and briefly points to open challenges.},

We also consider hypotheses concerning the validity of sparsification of a network (e.g., based on the strength of ties) and hypotheses restricting heterogeneity in peer effects (so that, e.g., only the number or fraction treated among neighboring units matters). Our general approach is to define an artificial experiment, such that the null hypothesis that was not sharp for the original experiment is sharp for the artificial experiment, and such that the randomization analysis for the artificial experiment is validated by the design of the original experiment.},

	abstract = {Quantile and quantile effect (QE) functions are important tools for descriptive and causal analysis due to their natural and intuitive interpretation. Existing inference methods for these functions do not apply to discrete random variables. This article offers a simple, practical construction of simultaneous confidence bands for quantile and QE functions of possibly discrete random variables. It is based on a natural transformation of simultaneous confidence bands for distribution functions, which are readily available for many problems. The construction is generic and does not depend on the nature of the underlying problem. It works in conjunction with parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric modeling methods for observed and counterfactual distributions, and does not depend on the sampling scheme. We apply our method to characterize the distributional impact of insurance coverage on health care utilization and obtain the distributional decomposition of the racial test score gap. We find that universal insurance coverage increases the number of doctor visits across the entire distribution, and that the racial test score gap is small at early ages but grows with age due to socio-economic factors especially at the top of the distribution.

In addition, outliers can be detected in a functional boxplot by the 1.5 times the 50\% central region empirical rule, analogous to the rule for classical boxplots. The construction of a functional boxplot is illustrated on a series of sea surface temperatures related to the El Niño phenomenon and its outlier detection performance is explored by simulations. As applications, the functional boxplot and enhanced functional boxplot are demonstrated on children growth data and spatio-temporal U.S. precipitation data for nine climatic regions, respectively.

Whether they fear rising wages, labor mobility or land redistribution, landowners have historically repressed agricultural workers and sustained autocracy. What might change landowning elites’ preferences for dictatorship and reduce their opposition to democracy? Change requires reducing landowners’ need to maintain political control over labor. This transition occurs when mechanization reduces the demand for agricultural workers, eliminating the need for labor-repressive policies. We explain how the adoption of labor-saving technology in agriculture alters landowners’ political preferences for different regimes, so that the more mechanized the agricultural sector, the more likely is democracy to emerge and survive. Our theoretical argument offers a parsimonious revision to Moore’s thesis that applies to the global transformation of agriculture since his Social Origins first appeared, and results from our cross-national statistical analyses strongly suggest that a positive relationship between agricultural mechanization and democracy does in fact exist.},

	abstract = {The income tax is a central pillar of the modern fiscal state because of its revenue-raising capacity and administrative sophistication. Existing accounts point to interstate war and class conflict as key drivers of modern fiscal breakthroughs. In this article, we evaluate a third explanation for the origins of fiscal capacity that highlights the importance of intraelite competition for political and economic power in times of rapid industrialization. Modern forms of taxation generated a conflict between industry and agriculture over the distribution of the tax burden across sectors. The presence of electoral institutions that connected tax payments to voting rights created opportunities to overcome this sectoral divide and facilitated the formation of a political consensus for fiscal innovation. The political coalition supporting income tax adoption included higher-income industrial and agricultural elites who anticipated fiscal and electoral gains associated with the adoption of the new tax. Drawing on parliamentary debates in Prussia and additional district-level data, we document both the origins and electoral and economic consequences of the new income tax. We show that the adoption of a highly sophisticated income tax in 1891 shifted the tax burden from land to industry and diluted the political influence of the middle class. The findings clarify the coalitional dynamics leading to fiscal tax adoption in nondemocratic contexts.},

Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a specific expression, corresponding to the object of your will, of your real individual life. If you love without evoking love in return—that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a beloved one, then your love is impotent—a misfortune." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095871)
"Rights to act are hollow in the absence of the enabling conditions, so that the inequality of these conditions is sufficient to generate unequal political influence. Second, money can be used to influence results of elections or to influence government policies given results of elections." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095875)

"Workers do not organize a party; rather, the party organizes workers" (Przeworski 2020:3232922095877)
"Why, then, must capitalism be replaced by another form of social organization? To answer this question, the reader must enter into Marx's peculiar accounting scheme. In Marx's terminology, capital has two parts: constant (fixed) + variable (labor). Then comes the crucial assumption: only labor generates surplus. Hence surplus value = variable capital, and total output = constant capital + variable capital + surplus." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095877)
"Capitalists are thus caught in a prisoner's dilemma: if one does not invest, he will be pushed out of the market by those who do; if all invest, the average rate of profit will decline." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095878)

"What Marx directs us to rethink is the structure of ownership and the corresponding distribution of power within firms." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095879)
"The question is whether firms with different ownership structures (employee owned, partly employee owned, publicly owned, state owned), exposed to competitive constraints, would generate higher incomes and more work satisfaction and whether a mix of such forms of ownership would generate higher social welfare than privately owned firms." (Przeworski 2020:3232922095879)

	abstract = {Psychology has traditionally seen itself as the science of universal human cognition, but has only recently begun seriously grappling with the issue of cross-cultural variation. Here we argue that the roots of cross-cultural variation often lie in the past. Therefore, to understand not just the way, but also why psychology varies, we need to grapple with cross-temporal variation. Psychology needs to become a historical science. The traces of past human cognition accessible through historical texts and artifacts can also serve as a valuable, and yet currently almost completely unutilized, source of psychological data. This data from dead minds opens up a new and untapped, highly diverse subject pool. The cohort effects we measure are a sliver of the temporal variation we should expect over history. We review examples of research that may be classified as historical psychology, introduce sources of historical data and methods for analyzing this data, explain the critical role of theory, and discuss the variety of ways in which psychologists can add historical depth and nuance to their work. Historical psychology is a critical next step toward becoming a genuinely universal science of human cognition and behavior.},

Important aspects of present-day psychology lie in the past—either the past environments of present-day societies or the past environments of migrants who live in these present-day societies. These beliefs and behaviors may persist even after the environment changes or after the group moves to a new environment (De Leersnyder et al. 2011; Dinesen 2012; Giavazzi et al. 2014; Mesoudi et al. 2016; Norris \& Inglehart 2012; Sinding Bentzen 2019)."

In many large-scale societies, these gods gradually acquired the traits of omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, co-evolving with the scale of their societies (Henrich 2020: Chapter 4" (Muthukrishna et al :52)
"psychology. One prediction is that those who believe more strongly in powerful moralizing gods should behave relatively more prosocially or fair-minded toward socially or even physically distant co-religionists." (Muthukrishna et al :52)
"The results from both experimental tasks demonstrate that those who believe more strongly in a moralizing, punishing god allocated the game money more equitably toward the distant coreligionist in both the Dictator and Random Allocation Games." (Muthukrishna et al :53)

"arbitrary: as Lukaszewski et al. (2019) analyses show, less socioecologically complex societies have greater intercorrelation between these five factors." (Muthukrishna et al :61)
"A dividing line of sorts is crossed when qualitative data, such as archeological site descriptions or analyses of ancient texts, is converted into quantitative data: for instance, the presence or absence of a certain type of artifact, belief or practice, a population estimate, or a continuous, standardized variable such as level of social complexity or frequency of ritual practice." (Muthukrishna et al :64)
"cognitive archeology" (Muthukrishna et al :64)

This sort of qualitative, descriptive data can play an important role in ruling out certain hypotheses." (Muthukrishna et al :65)
"more costly demands were correlated with commune longevity, supporting experimental evidence with contemporary subjects linking costly signaling to enhanced group solidarity and within-group cooperation (Henrich 2009; Irons 2001; Xygalatas et al. 2013)." (Muthukrishna et al :65)

It simplifies the well-known item count technique (ICT) by replacing a list of independent innocuous questions in known proportions with a single innocuous counting question. However, ICT and PICT both rely on the strong “no design effect assumption” (ie, respondents give the same answers to the innocuous items regardless of the absence or presence of the sensitive item in the list) and “no liar” (ie, all respondents give truthful answers) assumptions. To address the problem of self-protective behavior and provide more reliable analyses, we introduced a noncompliance parameter into the existing PICT. Based on the survey design of PICT, we considered more practical model assumptions and developed the corresponding statistical inferences. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of our method. Finally, a real example of automobile insurance fraud was used to demonstrate our method.},

"just three uses of "culture" are common (Figure 1A), and they all link it with social learning - learning assisted by observation of, or interaction with, another agent or its products. In order of increasing specificity, the term "culture" is used by evolutionists to refer to: 1) information or behaviour acquired through social learning; 2) one or more socially learned behaviours shared by the members of a group; or 3) socially learned behaviours that are shared by members of a group and have improved over successive episodes of social learning." (Heyes 2020:2)
"Culture1 is used when the purpose of enquiry is to find out how social learning influences evolutionary dynamics across the animal kingdom; when asking how social learning contributes to behavioural adaptation, interacts with genetic processes, and semi-detaches animals from ecological constraints. Culture1 has very little to do with what most people, in science and on the street, think of as culture." (Heyes 2020:2)
"the group-typicality must be due to the social learning, rather than to ecological or genetic differences between group" (Heyes 2020:3)
"There is evidence of Culture2 in primates and other mammals (e.g. dolphins, meerkats, mongoose, whales), fish and birds. S" (Heyes 2020:4)
"Culture2 tends to be used when the purpose of enquiry is to find out about the roots of human culture." (Heyes 2020:4)
"Culture3: "(i) a change in behaviour (or product of behaviour, such as an artefact), typically due to asocial learning, followed by (ii) the transfer via social learning of that novel or modified behaviour to other individuals or groups, where (iii) the learned behaviour causes an improvement in performance, which is a proxy of genetic and/or cultural fitness, with (iv) the previous three steps repeated in a manner that generates sequential improvement over time"" (Heyes 2020:5)
"This project aims to explain notable human achievements - from the control of fire and the construction of kayaks, through knowledge of quantum physics to exploration of Mars - and to identify forerunners of the relevant capacities in other animals." (Heyes 2020:5)
"The cultural selection, or third way, project asks whether there is another way in which the behaviour of a population can become adapted: a process that, in contrast with genetic evolution (1, the first way), selects among socially learned rather than genetically inherited variants, and, in contrast with intelligent design (2, the second way), where the adaptiveness of the selection does not depend on individuals or groups being smart enough to design novel solutions or to recognize what works and what does not." (Heyes 2020:7)
"Specifically, the anthropocentric project is compatible with the assumption - widely held since the Enlightenment and backed by evolutionary psychology - that humans are able to do remarkable things because each of us is smart. In contrast, the cultural selection project raises a radically new possibility. It suggests that many of our striking achievements, and those of other animals, depend on each of us being pretty dumb; that wisdom comes from the population-level process of cultural selection, rather than the workings of individual minds." (Heyes 2020:7)
"Rather than cognitive factors, the social structure of a species (e.g. how long juveniles spend in close proximity to their parents), and demographic variables (e.g. the size of social groups and their spatial distribution) have a major influence on the probability that Culture2 and Culture3 will emerge."

	abstract = {The major economic story of the last decade has been the surge and collapse of house prices worldwide. Yet political economists have had little to say about how this critical phenomenon affects citizens’ welfare and their demands from government. This article develops a novel theoretical argument linking housing prices to social policy preferences and policy outcomes. I argue that homeowners experiencing house price appreciation will become less supportive of redistribution and social insurance policies since increased house prices both increase individuals’ permanent income and the value of housing as self-supplied insurance against income loss. Political parties of the right will, responding to these preferences, cut social spending substantially during housing booms. I test these propositions using both microdata on social preferences from panel surveys in the USA, the UK, and a cross-country survey of 29 countries, and macrodata of national social spending for 18 countries between 1975 and 2001.},

	abstract = {Winner of the 2020 Outstanding Book Award Presented by the Public and Nonprofit Section of the National Academy of Management Winner of the 2019 Louis Brownlow Book Award from the National Academy of Public Administration  Bureaucracy, confusing paperwork, and complex regulations—or what public policy scholars Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan call administrative burdens—often introduce delay and frustration into our experiences with government agencies. Administrative burdens diminish the effectiveness of public programs and can even block individuals from fundamental rights like voting. In AdministrativeBurden, Herd and Moynihan document that the administrative burdens citizens regularly encounter in their interactions with the state are not simply unintended byproducts of governance, but the result of deliberate policy choices. Because burdens affect people’s perceptions of government and often perpetuate long-standing inequalities, understanding why administrative burdens exist and how they can be reduced is essential for maintaining a healthy public sector.  Through in-depth case studies of federal programs and controversial legislation, the authors show that administrative burdens are the nuts-and-bolts of policy design. Regarding controversial issues such as voter enfranchisement or abortion rights, lawmakers often use administrative burdens to limit access to rights or services they oppose. For instance, legislators have implemented administrative burdens such as complicated registration requirements and strict voter-identification laws to suppress turnout of African American voters. Similarly, the right to an abortion is legally protected, but many states require women seeking abortions to comply with burdens such as mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds, and scripted counseling. As Herd and Moynihan demonstrate, administrative burdens often disproportionately affect the disadvantaged who lack the resources to deal with the financial and psychological costs of navigating these obstacles.  However, policymakers have sometimes reduced administrative burdens or shifted them away from citizens and onto the government. One example is Social Security, which early administrators of the program implemented in the 1930s with the goal of minimizing burdens for beneficiaries. As a result, the take-up rate is about 100 percent because the Social Security Administration keeps track of peoples’ earnings for them, automatically calculates benefits and eligibility, and simply requires an easy online enrollment or visiting one of 1,200 field offices. Making more programs and public services operate this efficiently, the authors argue, requires adoption of a nonpartisan, evidence-based metric for determining when and how to institute administrative burdens, with a bias toward reducing them. By ensuring that the public’s interaction with government is no more onerous than it need be, policymakers and administrators can reduce inequality, boost civic engagement, and build an efficient state that works for all citizens.},

Nevertheless, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) representing these workers is vocally opposed to trade liberalization. We examine several competing explanations for this puzzle and evaluate them by tracing the union's stance on trade over several decades. We also use an original survey to compare ILWU affiliates' attitudes on trade with those of nonmembers with otherwise similar characteristics. Consistent with a model of organizational socialization, the data support the hypothesis that ILWU membership affects the members' revealed political opinions; the data are difficult to reconcile with standard theories of international trade. Our findings indicate that the political support for trade depends not just on voters' structural positions in the economy but also on the organizations and networks in which they are embedded.},

I report the results of Monte Carlo experiments examining the sensitivity of the ICT-MLE and simple difference-in-means estimators to survey design choices and small amounts of non-strategic respondent error. I show that, compared to the difference in means, the performance of the ICT-MLE depends on list design. Both estimators are sensitive to measurement error, but the problems are more severe for the ICT-MLE as a direct consequence of the no liars assumption. These problems become extreme as the number of treatment-group respondents choosing all the items on the list decreases.

	abstract = {The troubling ethics and politics of philanthropyIs philanthropy, by its very nature, a threat to today’s democracy? Though we may laud wealthy individuals who give away their money for society’s benefit, Just Giving shows how such generosity not only isn’t the unassailable good we think it to be but might also undermine democratic values and set back aspirations of justice. Big philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged. The affluent―and their foundations―reap vast benefits even as they influence policy without accountability. And small philanthropy, or ordinary charitable giving, can be problematic as well. Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality.These outcomes are shaped by the policies that define and structure philanthropy. When, how much, and to whom people give is influenced by laws governing everything from the creation of foundations and nonprofits to generous tax exemptions for donations of money and property. Rob Reich asks: What attitude and what policies should democracies have concerning individuals who give money away for public purposes? Philanthropy currently fails democracy in many ways, but Reich argues that it can be redeemed. Differentiating between individual philanthropy and private foundations, the aims of mass giving should be the decentralization of power in the production of public goods, such as the arts, education, and science. For foundations, the goal should be what Reich terms “discovery,” or long-time-horizon innovations that enhance democratic experimentalism. Philanthropy, when properly structured, can play a crucial role in supporting a strong liberal democracy.Just Giving investigates the ethical and political dimensions of philanthropy and considers how giving might better support democratic values and promote justice.},

We ask whether Indonesia’s national anti-poverty program, which transfers cash to hundreds of thousands of poor households, reduced deforestation as a side benefit. Although the program has no direct link to conservation, we estimate that it reduced tree cover loss in villages by 30\% (95\% confidence interval, 10 to 50\%). About half of the avoided losses were in primary forests, and reductions were larger when participation density was higher. The economic value of the avoided carbon emissions alone compares favorably to program implementation costs. The program’s environmental impact appears to be mediated through channels widely available in developing nations: consumption smoothing, whereby cash substitutes for deforestation as a form of insurance, and consumption substitution, whereby market-purchased goods substitute for deforestation-sourced goods. The results imply that anti-poverty programs targeted at the very poor can help achieve global environmental goals under certain conditions.
Modest, but persistent, transfers of cash to extremely poor households can provide both social and environmental benefits.

We apply these methods to eight categories of spending from the American states over the years 1984–2009 to reveal winners and losers in the scramble for government spending.

We argue that this relationship breaks down in contexts of weak ﬁscal capacity for two reasons: voters perceive collection as less fair and less generative of revenues. This less efﬁcient and more unequal tax extraction causes citizens to view taxation more negatively and thus punish politicians relatively more for tax increases. To investigate our argument, we exploit a loan program in Brazil designed to increase local ﬁscal capacity. The payout to municipalities, conditional on program application, generates a quasi-random shock to ﬁscal capacity. Consistent with our theory, we show that incumbent mayors in low-capacity places are punished for raising taxes, while those that received loans are not. We then use cross-national survey data to show that voter willingness to pay tax is correlated with perceived government performance only in high-capacity contexts.},

	abstract = {The social sciences—including economics—have long called for transparency in research to counter threats to producing robust and replicable results. In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of three of the more prominent proposed approaches: pre-analysis plans, hypothesis registries, and replications. They have been primarily discussed for experimental research, both in the field including randomized control trials and the laboratory, so we focus on these areas. A pre-analysis plan is a credibly fixed plan of how a researcher will collect and analyze data, which is submitted before a project begins. Though pre-analysis plans have been lauded in the popular press and across the social sciences, we will argue that enthusiasm for pre-analysis plans should be tempered for several reasons. Hypothesis registries are a database of all projects attempted; the goal of this promising mechanism is to alleviate the “file drawer problem,” which is that statistically significant results are more likely to be published, while other results are consigned to the researcher's “file drawer.” Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of replications. We argue that even with modest amounts of researcher bias—either replication attempts bent on proving or disproving the published work—or modest amounts of poor replication attempts—designs that are underpowered or orthogonal to the hypothesis—replications correct even the most inaccurate beliefs within three to five replications. We offer practical proposals for how to increase the incentives for researchers to carry out replications.},

(Coffman and Niederle 2015:88)"the rigidity of pre-analysis plans may also motivate researchers to know more about their design before they start" (Coffman and Niederle 2015:89)"for modest bias rates (say, 10 percent and below), we can expect posteriors not too distant from the truth after three to five replications."

Proponents of mutual aid have argued that these organizations were part of the rich associational culture of working-class life; that they represented a viable alternative to state welfare; and that they were eventually undermined by it. However, this article highlights the challenges that these organizations were already facing toward the end of the nineteenth century as a result of changes in working-class culture and the rise of more commercial insurance agencies. It suggests that the rise of state welfare was not so much a cause of these difficulties as a response to them. It also examines the role that friendly societies played in the expansion of welfare services after 1914 and their attitude to calls for further expansion before 1945.},

It has sometimes been suggested that the societies’ rich associational culture only came under threat following the expansion of state welfare provision during the early years of the twentieth century. However, many aspects of this culture were already under threat before the Liberals came to power. The main danger came less from the expansion of state welfare than from the increasing individualization of working-class life and the rise of more impersonal and commercial insurance opportunities. Judged from this standpoint, the rise of state welfare looks less like a cause of the friendly societies’ decline and more a response.
 
Although many organizations were initially hostile, both to old-age pensions and national insurance, they accepted that such developments might not only be inevitable but also desirable.

A researcher reports an estimate ĉ of a structural quantity of interest c that is exactly or asymptotically unbiased under some base model. The researcher also reports descriptive statistics that estimate features γ of the distribution of the data that are related to c under the base model. A reader entertains a less restrictive model that is local to the base model, under which the estimate ĉ may be biased. We study the reduction in worst-case bias from a restriction that requires the reader's model to respect the relationship between c and γ specified by the base model. Our main result shows that the proportional reduction in worst-case bias depends only on a quantity we call the informativeness of for ĉ. Informativeness can be easily estimated even for complex models. We recommend that researchers report estimated informativeness alongside their descriptive analyses, and we illustrate with applications to three recent papers.},

In each period of a dynamic game, a subordinate chooses his level of loyalty, which determines the dictator’s survival probability. He also performs another task—such as carrying out economic policy. The dictator’s decision each period is whether to hire a subordinate who is competent or incompetent at that task. An unemployed subordinate may be hired in the future, when the current dictator is removed from office. I show that less competent subordinates will be more loyal. As a result, dictators who value performance at economic tasks will hire more competent subordinates and will have shorter tenures. Incompetent subordinates will be hired more often if the dictators discount future payoffs less heavily or if the payoff from competence is smaller. The results show that, consistent with observation, longer tenures will not be associated with better economic performance.},

We study a case where status hierarchies were particularly extreme: the post-Civil War American South. During Reconstruction, under federal oversight, per capita taxation was higher in counties where slavery had been more extensive before the war, as predicted by standard theoretical models. After Reconstruction ended, however, taxes fell and bureaucratic capacity was weaker where slavery had been widespread. Moreover, higher intrawhite economic inequality was associated with lower taxes and weaker capacity after Reconstruction in formerly high-slavery counties. These findings on the interaction between intrawhite economic inequality and pre-War slavery suggest that elites built cross-class coalitions against taxation where whites sought to protect their racial status.},

We customize a recent such method for political science purposes, for instance so that it accommodates panel data, and provide an accompanying R-package. We evaluate the methodology, and how it behaves when different assumptions about the number and abrupt nature of change points are violated, by using simulated data. Importantly, the methodology allows us to evaluate changes to different quantities of interest (for various estimators). It also allows us to provide comprehensive estimates concerning uncertainty in the timing and size of changes. We illustrate the utility of this flexible change point methodology on two types of regression models (Probit and OLS) in two empirical applications. We first re-investigate the proposition by Albertus (2017) that labor-dependent agriculture had a more pronounced negative effect on democratic survival before the “third wave of democratization.” Next, we utilize data extending from the French revolution to the present, from V-Dem, to examine the time-variant nature of the income–democracy relationship.},

Climate politics can be understood as a contest between owners of assets that accelerate climate change, such as fossil fuel plants, and owners of assets vulnerable to climate change, such as coastal property. To date, obstruction by “climate-forcing” asset holders has been a large barrier to effective climate policy. But as climate change and decarbonization policies proceed, holders of both climate-forcing and “climate-vulnerable” assets stand to lose some or even all of their assets' value over time, and with them, the basis of their political power. This dynamic contest between opposing interests is likely to intensify in many sites of political contestation, from the subnational to transnational levels. As it does so, climate politics will become increasingly existential, potentially reshaping political alignments within and across countries. Such shifts may further undermine the Liberal International Order (LIO); as countries develop pro-climate policies at different speeds and magnitudes, they will have incentives to diverge from existing arrangements over trade and economic integration.},

With a close-election regression-discontinuity design, I show that mayors from the Workers' Party (PT) in fact slow down enforcement and improve conditions in the informal sector, rather than encouraging a shift to formal jobs. This reflects a challenge that leftist parties face across the world: how to simultaneously improve the employment prospects and conditions of workers in precarious employment and those in full-time jobs in the context of increased global competition, segmented labor markets and, in Latin America, truncated welfare states.},

	abstract = {To what extent do personal circumstances, as compared to ideological dispositions, drive voters’ preferences on welfare policy? Addressing this question is difficult because a person's ideological position can be an outcome of material interest rather than an independent source of preferences. The article deals with this empirical challenge using an original panel study carried out over four years, tracking the labor market experiences and the political attitudes of a national sample of Americans before and after the eruption of the financial crisis. The analysis shows that the personal experience of economic hardship, particularly the loss of a job, had a major effect on increasing support for welfare spending. This effect was appreciably larger among Republicans than among Democrats, a result that was not simply due to a “ceiling effect.” However the large attitudinal shift was short lived, dissipating as individuals’ employment situations improved. The results indicate that the personal experience of an economic shock has a sizable, yet overall transient effect on voters’ social policy preferences.},

	abstract = {Growing conventional wisdom holds that a chief driver of the populist vote is economic insecurity. I contend that this view overstates the role of economic insecurity as an explanation in several ways. First, it conflates the significance of economic insecurity in influencing the election outcome on the margin with its significance in explaining the overall populist vote. Empirical findings indicate that the share of populist support explained by economic insecurity is modest. Second, recent evidence indicates that voters’ concern with immigration—a key issue for many populist parties—is only marginally shaped by its real or perceived repercussions on their economic standing. Third, economics-centric accounts of populism treat voters’ cultural concerns as largely a byproduct of experiencing adverse economic change. This approach underplays the reverse process, whereby disaffection from social and cultural change drives both economic discontent and support for populism.},

	abstract = {The Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP) data set quantifies how much parties emphasize certain topics and positions and is very popular in the study of political parties. The data set is also increasingly applied in comparative political economy and welfare state studies that use the welfare-specific items rather than the CMP’s left–right scale to test hypotheses on the impact of political parties on social policies, (in)equality and the welfare state. But do these items provide a valid basis for descriptive and causal inferences? What do the items precisely capture? To answer these questions on concept validity, we use the new manifesto corpus data for German parties 2002–2013 and, to provide a further test, for US parties 2004–2012. Corpus data are the digitalized, originally hand-annotated and coded texts of electoral programmes. We assess the validity of the codings directly at the level of quasi-sentences by re-categorizing and subcategorizing the originally coded statements on equality, social justice and welfare state expansion. Although concept validity concerns about the data seem exaggerated, we find that theoretically relevant and meaningful variation is ‘hidden’ behind the original categories. Hence, our approach allows researchers to assess the substantive meaning of the CMP data directly, and we offer an efficient new strategy for testing more specific hypotheses on the impact of political parties on policy.},

We interviewed Ceselkoski and registered and attended his online course—the same course numerous Veles residents took offline. Our research confirms (1) the pivotal role Ceselkoski had in the creation of this industry; (2) the economic motivation driving the fake news disseminators; and (3) the manner in which the mostly young people in their early twenties with little English fluency were able to generate so much traffic and disseminate so much disinformation.},

Our exploration of 26 survey questions reveals both continuity and change in Americans’ attitudes toward liberal democracy. Whereas Americans have become more hostile toward some standard democratic procedural rules of the game, we also find that they harbor more tolerant attitudes toward racial and ethnic equality. We subjected respondents’ answers to an exploratory factor analysis, which reveals three distinct dimensions regarding democratic values: elitism, authoritarianism, and racial supremacy. We find that elitism and racial supremacy significantly influenced political behavior in the 2016 presidential election and note that these factors contributed to mass unrest in 2020, exposing fault lines deeply rooted in America’s contentious political history.},

	abstract = {Has rising import competition contributed to the polarization of US politics? Analyzing multiple measures of political expression and results of congressional and presidential elections spanning the period 2000 through 2016, we find strong though not definitive evidence of an ideological realignment in trade-exposed local labor markets that commences prior to the divisive 2016 US presidential election. Exploiting the exogenous component of rising import competition by China, we find that trade exposed electoral districts simultaneously exhibit growing ideological polarization in some domains, meaning expanding support for both strong-left and strong-right views, and pure rightward shifts in others. Specifically, trade-impacted commuting zones or districts saw an increasing market share for the Fox News channel (a rightward shift), stronger ideological polarization in campaign contributions (a polarized shift), and a relative rise in the likelihood of electing a Republican to Congress (a rightward shift). Trade-exposed counties with an initial majority White population became more likely to elect a GOP conservative, while trade-exposed counties with an initial majority-minority population became more likely to elect a liberal Democrat, where in both sets of counties, these gains came at the expense of moderate Democrats (a polarized shift). In presidential elections, counties with greater trade exposure shifted toward the Republican candidate (a rightward shift). These results broadly support an emerging political economy literature that connects adverse economic shocks to sharp ideological realignments that cleave along racial and ethnic lines and induce discrete shifts in political preferences and economic policy.

Nonetheless, governments routinely adopt austerity when confronting economic downturns and swelling deﬁcits. We explore this puzzle by distinguishing public acceptance of austerity as a general approach and support for speciﬁc austerity packages. Using original survey data from ﬁve European countries, we show that austerity is in fact the preferred response among most voters. We develop potential explanations for this surprising preference, and demonstrate the empirical limitations of accounts centered on economic interests or an intuitive framing advantage. Instead, we show that the preference for austerity is highly sensitive to its political backers and precise composition of spending cuts and tax hikes. Using a novel approach to estimate support for historical austerity programs, we contend that governments’ strategic crafting of policy packages is a key factor underlying the support for austerity.},

In developing countries, collecting data on basic economic quantities, such as wealth and income, is costly, time-consuming, and unreliable. Taking advantage of the ubiquity of mobile phones in Rwanda, Blumenstock et al. mapped mobile phone metadata inputs to individual phone subscriber wealth. They applied the model to predict wealth throughout Rwanda and show that the predictions matched well with those from detailed boots-on-the-ground surveys of the population.
Science, this issue p. 1073
Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social and economic research and policy. In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individual’s past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
Metadata from individuals’ phones can be used to predict aggregate-level characteristics such as access to electricity.

	abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable (Meehl, 1990). In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalising procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and impactful. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychologists have begun to realise that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound ‘derivation chain’ between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various non-confirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and their functional form, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognised and incentivised as a crucial goal in and of itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to non-confirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology’s reform movement and help us lay the foundation to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged us to.},

Second, we explore the bias-variance trade-off inherent in the choice between direct and indirect measurement technologies. Third, to estimate the extent of sensitivity bias, we meta-analyze the set of published and unpublished list experiments (a.k.a., the item count technique) conducted to date and compare the results with direct questions.

	abstract = {Racial bias in health algorithms
The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer et al. find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.
Science, this issue p. 447; see also p. 421
Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.
A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.

The continuing refugee crisis has made it necessary for governments to find ways to resettle individuals and families in host communities. Bansak et al. used a machine learning approach to develop an algorithm for geographically placing refugees to optimize their overall employment rate. The authors developed and tested the algorithm on segments of registry data from the United States and Switzerland. The algorithm improved the employment prospects of refugees in the United States by ∼40\% and in Switzerland by ∼75\%.
Science, this issue p. 325
Developed democracies are settling an increased number of refugees, many of whom face challenges integrating into host societies. We developed a flexible data-driven algorithm that assigns refugees across resettlement locations to improve integration outcomes. The algorithm uses a combination of supervised machine learning and optimal matching to discover and leverage synergies between refugee characteristics and resettlement sites. The algorithm was tested on historical registry data from two countries with different assignment regimes and refugee populations, the United States and Switzerland. Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70\%, on average, in refugees’ employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices. This approach can provide governments with a practical and cost-efficient policy tool that can be immediately implemented within existing institutional structures.

It is a practical document that brings all the legal guidance together in one place, and is written in the context of new data science capabilities. As part of its development, we ran a public dialogue on data science ethics, including deliberative workshops, an experimental conjoint survey and an online engagement tool. The research supported the principles set out in the framework as well as provided useful insight into how we need to communicate about data science. It found that people had a low awareness of the term ‘data science’, but that showing data science examples can increase broad support for government exploring innovative uses of data. But people's support is highly context driven. People consider acceptability on a case-by-case basis, first thinking about the overall policy goals and likely intended outcome, and then weighing up privacy and unintended consequences. The ethical framework is a crucial start, but it does not solve all the challenges it highlights, particularly as technology is creating new challenges and opportunities every day. Continued research is needed into data minimization and anonymization, robust data models, algorithmic accountability, and transparency and data security. It also has revealed the need to set out a renewed deal between the citizen and state on data, to maintain and solidify trust in how we use people's data for social good.This article is part of the themed issue ‘The ethical impact of data science’.},

However, across two field experiments with Chinese factory workers and American university staff, small adjustments to people’s experience of participation in the workplace shifted these attitudes one month later. Both experiments randomly assigned work groups to a 20-minute participatory meeting once per week for six weeks, in which the supervisor stepped aside and workers discussed problems, ideas, and goals regarding their work (vs. a status quo meeting). Across 97 work groups and 1,924 workers, participatory meetings led workers to be less authoritarian and more critical about societal authority and justice, and to be more willing to participate in political, social, and familial decision-making. These findings provide rare experimental evidence of the theoretical predictions regarding participatory democracy: that local participatory experiences can influence broader democratic attitudes and empowerment.},

	abstract = {Occupations have long been held by sociologists, from the older status attainment tradition to the more recent micro-class tradition, to be at the center of stratification writ large. Occupations are specifically argued to be central to shaping wages. Indeed, this has been understood as the comparative advantage of sociology relative to economics in understanding wage setting. However, an undercurrent has for decades existed in sociology that suggests other contexts, mainly workplaces and jobs, may be as important if not more important stratification contexts. Until recently data with the capacity to simultaneously assess all three contexts has been virtually non-existent. In this paper we use administrative data from five countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, and South Korea) to assess the relative contributions of occupations, establishments, and jobs to wages. Our core finding is that there is no universal link between occupations and wages, with occupations explaining between 30 and 56 \% of wage variance across country-years. As well, in all countries except Finland establishments explain more of the variance in wages than do occupations. Jobs and establishment figure prominently in the social organization of wages, and must be included in theoretical models and whenever possible in empirical analyses of social stratification.},

We formalize three fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and we prove that except in highly constrained special cases, there is no method that can satisfy these three conditions simultaneously. Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them.},

	abstract = {With the widespread use of AI systems and applications in our everyday lives, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration while designing and engineering these types of systems. Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

In this article, we seek to clarify the trade-offs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy.Methods:We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science, and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments.Results:We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy.Conclusions:Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging trade-offs. These lessons apply to applications well beyond criminology where assessments of risk can be used by decision makers.

What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difﬁcult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual inﬁnite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},

In most of these cases, the algorithms are viewed as additional tools for use by judges, analysts and policy-makers – a form of hybrid decision-making. But such hybridization relies on the level of trust people have in these algorithms, both by the policy-maker and the public. This paper reports the results of a series of experiments on individual trust in algorithms for forecasting political events and criminal recidivism. We ﬁnd that people are quite trusting in algorithms relative to other sources of advice, even with minimal information about the algorithm or when they are explicitly told that humans are just as good at the task. Using a conjoint experiment, we evaluate the factors that inﬂuence people’s preferences for these algorithms, ﬁnding that several of the factors of common concerns for scholars are of little concern for the public.},

We recast the causal inference problem as a counterfactual prediction and a structural breaks testing problem. This allows us to exploit insights from conformal prediction and structural breaks testing to develop permutation inference procedures that accommodate modern high-dimensional estimators, are valid under weak and easy-to-verify conditions, and are provably robust against misspeciﬁcation. Our methods work in conjunction with many diﬀerent approaches for predicting counterfactual mean outcomes in the absence of the policy intervention. Examples include synthetic controls, diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences, factor and matrix completion models, and (fused) time series panel data models. Our approach demonstrates an excellent small-sample performance in simulations and is taken to a data application where we re-evaluate the consequences of decriminalizing indoor prostitution.},

	abstract = {In this review, we present econometric and statistical methods for analyzing randomized experiments. For basic experiments we stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of stratified, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we stress the general efficiency gains from stratification. We also discuss complications in randomized experiments such as non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment effect heterogeneity. We consider in detail estimation and inference for heterogeneous treatment effects in settings with (possibly many) covariates. These methods allow researchers to explore heterogeneity by identifying subpopulations with different treatment effects while maintaining the ability to construct valid confidence intervals. We also discuss optimal assignment to treatment based on covariates in such settings. Finally, we discuss estimation and inference in experiments in settings with interactions between units, both in general network settings and in settings where the population is partitioned into groups with all interactions contained within these groups.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study methods for estimating causal effects in settings with panel data, where some units are exposed to a treatment during some periods and the goal is estimating counterfactual (untreated) outcomes for the treated unit/period combinations. We develop a class of matrix completion estimators that uses the observed elements of the matrix of control outcomes corresponding to untreated unit/periods to impute the "missing" elements of the control outcome matrix, corresponding to treated units/periods. The approach estimates a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for matrices. We generalize results from the matrix completion literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure. We present novel insights concerning the connections between the matrix completion literature, the literature on interactive fixed effects models and the literatures on program evaluation under unconfoundedness and synthetic control methods. We show that all these estimators can be viewed as focusing on the same objective function. They differ in the way they deal with lack of identification, in some cases solely through regularization (our proposed nuclear norm matrix completion estimator) and in other cases primarily through imposing hard restrictions (the unconfoundedness and synthetic control approaches). proposed method outperforms unconfoundedness-based or synthetic control estimators.},

Recent arguments suggest that credit markets fill gaps left by limited social benefits but often rest on thin empirical grounds. This article makes two contributions to this debate by using micro-level panel data and leveraging variation in welfare state generosity across US states and over time. First, it shows that households that experience unemployment borrow significantly more in states where unemployment benefits are low compared to states where benefits are high. A 10-percentage-point decrease in unemployment replacement rates increases debt levels by about 30 per cent, or \$5,300. Secondly, the article documents that rising indebtedness in the context of weak social policies has political consequences and increases support for a stronger safety net. One explanation is that voters seek social protection against downstream debt-induced economic risks. These findings suggest that welfare states can play a critical role in mitigating growing indebtedness.},

When the disadvantaged and insecure are mostly one and the same, the base of popular support for the welfare state is narrow. When the disadvantaged and insecure represent two distinct groups, popular support is broader and opinion less polarized. We test these predictions both across nations within a single policy area (unemployment insurance) and across policy domains within a single polity (the United States, using a new survey). Results are consistent with our predictions and are robust to myriad controls and specifications. When disadvantage and insecurity are more correlated, the welfare state is more contested.},

The ESI assesses the individual-level occurrence of substantial year-to-year declines in available household resources, accounting for fluctuations not only in income but also in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It also assesses whether those experiencing such declines have sufficient liquid financial wealth to buffer against these shocks. We find that insecurity—the share of individuals experiencing substantial resource declines without adequate financial buffers—has risen steadily since the mid-1980s for virtually all subgroups of Americans, albeit with cyclical fluctuation. At the same time, we find that there is substantial disparity in the degree to which different subgroups are exposed to economic risk. As the ESI derives from a data-independent conceptual foundation, it can be measured using different panel datasets. We find that the degree and disparity by which insecurity has risen is robust across the best available sources.},

Using my trooper level measure of bias, I identify causal relationships between bias and labor outcomes using a panel data set of trooper employment outcomes. I show troopers were able to use misreporting to evade detection of bias, with bias having no eﬀect on labor market outcomes when the misreporting was possible. I ﬁnd that after a rule change to trooper stop recording policy in response to the discovery of misreporting led to negative labor outcomes for biased troopers, speciﬁcally, lower rates of promotion and lower rates salary growth. I further test how individual trooper bias changes in response to changes in peer, demographic compositions.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023},
	abstract = {The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.},

(Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:12)"the most common legal and economic understandings of fairness are concerned with what happens at the margin (e.g., whether the same standard is applied to all individuals). What happens at the margin also determines whether decisions maximize social welfare, with the optimal threshold set at the point where the marginal benets equal the marginal costs. However, popular error metrics assess behavior away from the margin, hence they are called infra -marginal statistics. As a result, when risk distributions dier, standard error metrics are often poor proxies for individual equity or social well-being." (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:12)"To the extent that error metrics dier across groups, that tells us more about the shapes of the risk distributions than about the quality of decisions. In particular, it is hard to determine whether dierences in error rates are due to discrimination or to dierences in the risk distributions."

(Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:15)"A second misconception is that the false positive rate is a reasonable proxy of a group's aggregate wellbeing, loosely dened."

(Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:17)"and indeed label bias is perhaps the most serious obstacle facing fair machine learning" (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:18)"two key diculties with this assumption. First, though we might want to measure violent crime conducted by defendants awaiting trial, we typically only observe crime that results in a conviction or an arrest." (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:18)"Poor outcome data might thus cause one to systematically underestimate the risk posed by white defendants. The second, related, issue is that y is a counterfactual outcome; it denotes what would have happened had a defendant been released. In reality, we only observe what happened conditional on the judge's actual detention decision." (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018:18)},

	abstract = {Conformal prediction is a technique for constructing prediction intervals that attain valid coverage in finite samples, without making distributional assumptions. Despite this appeal, existing conformal methods can be unnecessarily conservative because they form intervals of constant or weakly varying length across the input space. In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efficiency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

We find strong evidence that, unlike their modern substitutes, cooperative societies were able to overcome the asymmetry of information.

Many households are financially fragile despite having high incomes and wealth, because they hold little liquid savings. We hypothesize, and show empirically, that this implies that a substantial group of voters show strong support for social insurance policies despite being wealthy and having high incomes, because of their limited ability to self-insure through own savings in case of an income shock. Our empirical analysis is based on a novel dataset from Denmark, which combines administrative data with high-quality measures of individual financial assets and survey measures of political preferences. Using data for other countries from the European Social Survey, we find evidence that our results hold more generally and are not specific to the Danish context.},

	abstract = {In overlapping‐generations models of public‐goods provision, in which the contribution decision is binary and lifetimes are finite, the set of symmetric subgame‐perfect equilibria can be categorized into three types: seniority equilibria, in which players contribute (effort) until a predetermined age and then shirk thereafter; dependency equilibria, in which players initially shirk, then contribute for a set number of periods, then shirk for the remainder of their lives; and sabbatical equilibria, in which players alternately contribute and shirk for periods of varying length before entering a final stage of shirking. In a world without discounting we establish conditions for equilibrium and demonstrate that for any dependency equilibrium there is a seniority equilibrium that Pareto dominates it ex ante. We proceed to characterize generational preferences over alternative seniority equilibria. We explore the aggregation of these preferences by embedding the public‐goods provision game in a voting framework and solving for the majority‐rule equilibria. In this way we can think of political processes as providing one natural framework for equilibrium selection in the original public‐goods provision game.},

Agents different in age, income and in their ability to invest in the capital market vote on the degree of redistribution of the social security system and on the size of the transfer.

While many predict lower union membership, few have considered how Janus will challenge the overall cost-sharing strategy that unions use to ensure their affiliates’ organizational maintenance and survival. Using the National Education Association (NEA) as our empirical example, we develop and test a theory we call “financial solidarity,” which posits that union organizational maintenance hinges on the transfer of resources from affiliates in strong labor states to those in weaker labor states. We demonstrate that this system is in effect by showing that most NEA revenue originates from dues and fees paid by teachers in strong labor states and then by examining the causal effect of labor law retrenchment on affiliates’ reliance on their national union between 2005–2018. We find that the NEA transfers an additional \$6–10 per member and is significantly more likely to make a political contribution in an affiliate’s state in the aftermath of retrenchment. These findings highlight that unions are maintained on an organizational model that relies on a balance of strong and weak state labor laws. By upending that equilibrium, Janus threatens to undermine the power of labor in American politics.},

"As a way to understand the future impact of Janus, we examine the extent to which federated unions redistribute resources from their stronger to their weaker affiliates, a process that we call "financial solidarity."" (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"NEA's annually reported tax forms, we show,first, that national federated unions like the NEA are funded primarily by membership dues and agency fees, the bulk of which come from affiliates located in states that long ago adopted labor laws favorable to union organizing." (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"estimate the causal effect of legal retrenchment on federated-union activity at the national level." (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"Federated interest groups, in particular, are an important part of the interest group universe. Virtually all labor unions in the United States operate on a federated structure (Martin 2007), as well as many types of interest groups (McCarthy 2005) and membership organizations (Skocpol, Ganz, and Munson 2000; Skocpol 2003)." (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"In short, federated interest groups need to ensure that their affiliates are in unions, this is precisely what Janus challenges: the ability of federated organizations to maintain themselves by relying on affiliates in favorable subnational legal environments." (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"automatic deduction of part of their dues for political purposes.4 Janus now bans agency fees for public workers in allfifty states" (Finger and Hartney 2021:20)
"Importantly, dues and (before Janus) agency fee rates are both set and paid separately to a member's local, state, and national union. Dues that are paid to the local and state affiliates stay nearby, funding state and local program efforts (e.g., collective" (Finger and Hartney 2021:21)
"bargaining, state and local newsletter production). However, the dues and fees that workers pay directly to the national union are often redistributed back to the unions' state affiliates." (Finger and Hartney 2021:22)
"first, federated unions should be funded primarily by membership dues and agency fees paid by workers in strong labor law states. Second, as revenue-producers, states with favorable labor laws should depend less on national union revenue than states operating under RTW laws or without mandatory bargaining. Third, if affiliates in states with weaker labor laws do, in fact, rely on affiliates in states with stronger labor laws via transfers from the national organization's budget, then the passage of a labor retrenchment law should theoretically lead to subsequent increases in the share of state affiliates' budgets coming from their national (parent) union, compared to the budgets of union affiliates in states without such labor law changes." (Finger and Hartney 2021:22)
"The strength of a state's labor law is inversely correlated with a federated-union affiliate's reliance on its national (parent) union forfinancial suppor" (Finger and Hartney 2021:22)
"This is because the parent union will not be able to utilize resources from strong affiliates' now-illegal agency fees." (Finger and Hartney 2021:22)

"strong labor law states if, in a given year, the affiliate had the benefit of a mandatory teacher bargaining law without any RTW restrictions precluding the affiliate from negotiating and levying agency fees on non-members." (Finger and Hartney 2021:23)
"the national union has relied almost exclusively on the dues and fees of individual members to fund its operations, including, importantly, any funds the union transfers to its sub-national affiliates." (Finger and Hartney 2021:23)
"revenue coming from dues and fees was83\%." (Finger and Hartney 2021:23)
"each of its separate state union affiliate" (Finger and Hartney 2021:24)

However, there is little rigorous microeconomic explanation of union membership which is relevant for much of the U.K. and similar labour markets where the ‘open shop’ union is prevalent. This paper attempts to overcome the free-rider problem of explaining union membership in the open shop. We argue that both private pecuniary gains and social influences affect the individuals' union membership decisions, citing evidence in support of these basic assumptions. We show that stable intermediate union density is a possible equilibrium outcome in a generalised social custom model. We also analyse the simultaneous determination of wages and union membership, deriving a number of comparative static results. In particular, we find that both wages and union density depend upon, inter alia, the level of strike pay, the net cost of union membership and the individual's sensitivity to social custom and associated solidarity effects. We argue that the approach is consistent with various stylised facts concerning both wage bargaining and union membership and is able to explain a number of otherwise puzzling features of union membership.},

Instead, Americans saved less and borrowed more to maintain relative consumption in the face of widening economic disparities. This article proposes a theory in which fiscal redistribution dampens the willingness of citizens to borrow to fund current consumption. A key implication is that pretax inequality will be more tightly linked with credit in less redistributive countries. The long-run partisan composition of government is, in turn, a key determinant of redistributive effort. Examining a panel of eighteen OECD democracies, the authors find that countries with limited histories of left-wing participation in government are significantly more likely see credit expansion as prefisc inequality grows compared to those in which the political left has been more influential.},

The JPMorgan Chase Institute has assembled high-frequency, categorized data on income and expenditure for millions of households, which allow us to describe the impacts of specific fluctuations in income (a tax refund and a job loss) and prices (fuel prices and mortgage interest rates) that vary in terms of predictability and duration. We observe spending responses to changes that were predictable or had limited impact on lifetime income. We identify spending changes in response to new information versus the cash flow event itself and in specific categories of consumption where consumers would likely prefer timing to be driven by needs rather than cash flow, such as healthcare. Our findings suggest that frameworks which rely on rational expectations and intertemporal optimization are of limited usefulness for understanding consumer behavior or designing policies and financial product offerings.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that earnings inequalities have risen in many high-income countries. Less clear are the linkages between rising income inequality and workplace dynamics, how within- and between-workplace inequality varies across countries, and to what extent these inequalities are moderated by national labor market institutions. In order to describe changes in the initial between- and within-firm market income distribution we analyze administrative records for 2,000,000,000+ job years nested within 50,000,000+ workplace years for 14 high-income countries in North America, Scandinavia, Continental and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. We find that countries vary a great deal in their levels and trends in earnings inequality but that the between-workplace share of wage inequality is growing in almost all countries examined and is in no country declining. We also find that earnings inequalities and the share of between-workplace inequalities are lower and grew less strongly in countries with stronger institutional employment protections and rose faster when these labor market protections weakened. Our findings suggest that firm-level restructuring and increasing wage inequalities between workplaces are more central contributors to rising income inequality than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {We use a massive, matched employer-employee database for the United States to analyze the contribution of firms to the rise in earnings inequality from 1978 to 2013. We find that one-third of the rise in the variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+ employee) firms, which saw a particularly large increase in the variance of earnings compared with smaller firms.},

The authors define the construct of ‘persuasion’ as a change in the systematic component of an individual's preference, separate from measurement error, that results from exposure to interpersonal interaction. Their method separately measures persuasion in a latent (left–right) preference space and in a topic-specific preference space. The model's functional form accommodates tests of substantive hypotheses found in the small-group literature. The article illustrates the measurement method by examining changes in study participants' views on US fiscal policy resulting from the composition of the small discussion groups to which they were randomly assigned. The results are inconsistent with the ‘law of small-group polarization’, the typical result found in small-group research; instead, the authors observe patterns of latent and policy-specific persuasion consistent with the aspirations of deliberation.},

In many countries, reports of growing geographic political polarization raise concerns about the stability of democratic governance. Here, using advances in spatial data computation, we measure individual partisan segregation by calculating the local residential segregation of every registered voter in the United States, creating a spatially weighted measure for more than 180 million individuals. With these data, we present evidence of extensive partisan segregation in the country. A large proportion of voters live with virtually no exposure to voters from the other party in their residential environment. Such high levels of partisan isolation can be found across a range of places and densities and are distinct from racial and ethnic segregation. Moreover, Democrats and Republicans living in the same city, or even the same neighbourhood, are segregated by party. Enos and Brown find that voters in US are highly spatially segregated by party. Republicans and Democrats tend to segregate even when living in the same neighbourhoods, and this segregation persists in both urban and rural areas.},

In contrast, non-Bayesian models are typically compared using cross-validation on held-out data, either through \$k\$-fold partitioning or leave-\$p\$-out subsampling. We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-\$p\$-out crossvalidation averaged over all values of \$p\$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive score is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation, and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase.

These measurements, sometimes called time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data, allow researchers to estimate a broad set of causal quantities, including contemporaneous effects and direct effects of lagged treatments. Unfortunately, popular methods for TSCS data can only produce valid inferences for lagged effects under very strong assumptions. In this paper, we use potential outcomes to define causal quantities of interest in this settings and clarify how standard models like the autoregressive distributed lag model can produce biased estimates of these quantities due to post-treatment conditioning. We then describe two estimation strategies that avoid these post-treatment biases—inverse probability weighting and structural nested mean models—and show via simulations that they can outperform standard approaches in small sample settings. We illustrate these methods in a study of how welfare spending affects terrorism.},

Neural relational inference (NRI) is a deep generative model that can reason about relations in complex dynamics without supervision. In this paper, we take a careful look at this approach for relational inference in multi-agent trajectories. First, we discover that NRI can be fundamentally limited without sufficient long-term observations. Its ability to accurately infer interactions degrades drastically for short output sequences. Next, we consider a more general setting of relational inference when interactions are changing overtime. We propose an extension ofNRI, which we call the DYnamic multi-AgentRelational Inference (DYARI) model that can reason about dynamic relations. We conduct exhaustive experiments to study the effect of model architecture, under-lying dynamics and training scheme on the performance of dynamic relational inference using a simulated physics system. We also showcase the usage of our model on real-world multi-agent basketball trajectories.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (

	abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

	abstract = {This paper studies whether adverse selection can rationalize a universal mandate for unemployment insurance (UI). Building on a unique feature of the unemployment policy in Sweden, where workers can opt for supplemental UI coverage above a minimum mandate, we provide the first direct evidence for adverse selection in UI and derive its implications for UI design. We find that the unemployment risk is more than twice as high for workers who buy supplemental coverage. Exploiting variation in risk and prices, we show how 25–30 percent of this correlation is driven by risk-based selection, with the remainder driven by moral hazard. Due to the moral hazard and despite the adverse selection we find that mandating the supplemental coverage to individuals with low willingness-to-pay would be suboptimal. We show under which conditions a design leaving choice to workers would dominate a UI system with a single mandate. In this design, using a subsidy for supplemental coverage is optimal and complementary to the use of a minimum mandate. (JEL D82, G22, J65)},

We show that these mechanisms, which are based on off-equilibrium arbitration clauses that impose large fines for lying and the inappropriate use of arbitration, have severe behavioral constraints because the fines induce retaliation against legitimate uses of arbitration. Incorporating reciprocity preferences into the theory explains the observed behavioral patterns and helps us develop a new mechanism that is more robust and achieves high rates of truth-telling and efficiency. Our results highlight the importance of tailoring implementation mechanisms to the underlying behavioral environment. (JEL C92, D44, D82, D86, D91)},

However, the study of wealth, which is more unequally distributed than income, has been largely understudied within CPE. Using new data from the World Income Database (WID), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and OECD countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates. The article concludes by examining how the changing dynamics of housing prices and wealth inequality will increasingly shape intergenerational – and associated class-based – political conflict in Western Europe.},

This is the theory of “structural dependence of the state on capital.” Using a formal model, the internal logic and the robustness of the theory is examined. We conclude that in a static sense the theory is false: virtually any distribution of consumption between wage earners and owners of capital is compatible with continual private investment once an appropriate set of taxes and transfers is in place. Yet the state may be structurally dependent in a dynamic sense. Policies that, once in place, redistribute income without reducing investment do reduce investment during the period in which they are anticipated but not yet implemented.},

	abstract = {Amid the long decline of US unions, research on union wage effects has struggled with selection problems and inadequate theory. I draw on the sociology of labor to argue that unions use non-market sources of power to pressure companies into raising wages. This theory of union power implies a new test of union wage effects: does union activism have an effect on wages that is not reducible to workers’ market position? Two institutional determinants of union activity are used to empirically isolate the wage effect of union activism from labor market conditions: increased union revenue from investment shocks and increased union activity leading up to union officer elections. Instrumental variable analysis of panel data from the Department of Labor shows that a 1 percent increase in union spending increases a proxy for union members’ wages between 0.15 percent and 0.30 percent. These wage effects are larger in years of active collective bargaining, and when unions increase spending in ways that could pressure companies. The results indicate that non-market sources of union power can affect workers’ wages and that even in a period of labor weakness unions still play a role in setting wages for their members.},

	abstract = {The post–World War II period of wage compression provides a strong contrast to the last forty years of rising inequality. In this article, I argue that inequality was previously constrained by pay coordination that spanned multiple workplaces. Cross-workplace coordination practices range from multi-employer bargaining agreements to informal employer collusion. To quantify the influence of these practices on inequality, I draw on establishment-level Bureau of Labor Statistics microdata from 1968 to 1977. Inequality between workplaces did not increase during the 1970s and inequality was lower among workers likely to be covered by cross-workplace coordination. Unionization, large establishments, and pension provision reduced inequality across workplaces, not only among coworkers within workplaces. These findings indicate that cross-workplace coordination mitigated inequality during the postwar period of egalitarian economic growth.},

	abstract = {What explains pay inequality among coworkers? Theories of organizational influence on inequality emphasize the effects of formal hierarchy. But restructuring, firm flattening, and individualized pay setting have challenged the relevance of these structuralist theories. I propose a new organizational theory of differences in pay, focused on task structure and the horizontal division of labor across jobs. When organizations specialize jobs, they reduce the variety of tasks performed by some workers. In doing so they leave exclusive job turf to other coworkers, who capture the learning and discretion associated with performing a distinct task. The division of labor thus erodes pay premiums for some workers while advantaging others through job turf. I test this theory with linked employer–employee panel data from U.S. labor unions, which include a type of data that is rarely collected: annual reporting on work tasks. Results show that reducing task variety lowers workers’ earnings, while increasing job turf raises earnings. When organizations reduce task variety for some workers, they increase job turf for others. Without assuming fixed job hierarchies and pay rates, interdependencies in organizational task allocation yield unequal pay premiums among coworkers.},

	abstract = {I set out and explain Piketty's model of the dynamics of capitalism based on two equations and the r {\textgreater} g inequality (his central contradiction of capitalism). I then take issue with Piketty's analysis of the rebuilding of inequality from the 1970s to the present on three grounds: First, his model is based on the (neo-classical) assumption that companies are essentially passive actors who invest the amount savers choose to accumulate at equilibrium output – leading to the counterintuitive result that companies respond to the secular fall in growth (and hence their product markets) from the 1970s on by increasing their investment relative to output; this does indeed imply increased inequality on Piketty's β measure, the ratio of capital to output. I suggest a more realistic model in which businesses determine investment growth based on their expectations of output growth, with monetary policy bringing savings into line with business-determined investment; the implication of this model is that β does not change at all. And in fact as other recent empirical work which I reference has noted, β has not changed significantly over these recent decades. Hence Piketty's central analysis of the growth of contemporary inequality requires rethinking. Second, despite many references to the need for political economic analysis, Piketty's analysis of the growth of inequality in the period from the 1970s to the present is almost devoid of it, his explanatory framework being purely mathematical. I sketch what a political economic framework might look like during a period when politics was central to inequality. Third, inequality in fact rose on a variety of dimensions apart from β (including poverty which Piketty virtually makes no reference to in this period), but it is unclear what might explain why inequality rose in these other dimensions.},

A communication network helps coordination in exactly two ways: by informing each stage about earlier stages, and by creating common knowledge within each stage. We then consider two examples: first we show that “low dimensional” networks can be better for coordination even though they have far fewer links than “high dimensional” networks; second we show that wide dispersion of “insurgents”, people predisposed toward participation, can be good for coordination but too much dispersion can be bad.},

Besides historical financial data for each municipality, we use alternative institutional data along with the socio-demographic and economic context. The predictability is analyzed through the performance of the statistical and machine learning models with a receiver operating characteristic curve and the precision-recall curve. Our results suggest that it is possible to make out-of-sample predictions with a high true positive rate and low false-positive rate. The model shows that some non-financial features (e.g. geographical area) are more important than many financial features to predict the default of municipalities. Among financial indicators, the important features are mainly connected to the Deficit and the Debt of Municipalities. Among the socio-demographic characteristics of administrators, the gender and the age of members in council are among the top 10 features in terms of importance for predicting municipal defaults.},

Thus, if politics feels like debate, people will be motivated to argue for their side. If politics feels like deliberation, they will be motivated to seek consensus through open-minded processing. Results from three experiments demonstrate: (1) Politics evokes thoughts similar to conflictual contexts and dissimilar from deliberative contexts. (2) Consequently, information labeled “political” primes the motivation to counterargue, leading to opinion polarization. Absent such labeling, no such motivation is evident, explaining why bias is common but not inherent to politics. (3) Despite this capacity for bias, people can be motivated to actively process and accept counterattitudinal information by simply making the value of open-mindedness salient. This suggests open-minded discourse is possible even absent motivation to evaluate information accurately. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for political discourse.},

We develop the case of estimating average unit-level causal effects from a randomized experiment with interference of arbitrary but known form. The resulting estimators are based on inverse probability weighting. We provide randomization-based variance estimators that account for the complex clustering that can occur when interference is present. We also establish consistency and asymptotic normality under local dependence assumptions. We discuss refinements including covariate-adjusted effect estimators and ratio estimation. We evaluate empirical performance in realistic settings with a naturalistic simulation using social network data from American schools. We then present results from a field experiment on the spread of anti-conflict norms and behavior among school students.},

	abstract = {Causal effects are often characterized with averages, which can give an incomplete picture of the underlying counterfactual distributions. Here we consider estimating the entire counterfactual density and generic functionals thereof. We focus on two kinds of target parameters. The first is a density approximation, defined by a projection onto a finite-dimensional model using a generalized distance metric, which includes f-divergences as well as \$L\_p\$ norms. The second is the distance between counterfactual densities, which can be used as a more nuanced effect measure than the mean difference, and as a tool for model selection. We study nonparametric efficiency bounds for these targets, giving results for smooth but otherwise generic models and distances. Importantly, we show how these bounds connect to means of particular non-trivial functions of counterfactuals, linking the problems of density and mean estimation. We go on to propose doubly robust-style estimators for the density approximations and distances, and study their rates of convergence, showing they can be optimally efficient in large nonparametric models. We also give analogous methods for model selection and aggregation, when many models may be available and of interest. Our results all hold for generic models and distances, but throughout we highlight what happens for particular choices, such as \$L\_2\$ projections on linear models, and KL projections on exponential families. Finally we illustrate by estimating the density of CD4 count among patients with HIV, had all been treated with combination therapy versus zidovudine alone, as well as a density effect. Our results suggest combination therapy may have increased CD4 count most for high-risk patients. Our methods are implemented in the freely available R package npcausal on GitHub.},

However, our approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a wide range of biases that can distort causal inference. I present ten examples of collider bias drawn from economic history research, focussing mainly on examples where the authors were able to overcome or mitigate the bias. Thus, the paper highlights how to diagnose collider bias and also strategies for managing it. The paper also shows that quasi-random experimental designs are rarely able to overcome collider bias. Although all of these biases were understood by economic historians before, conceptualising them as collider bias will improve economic historians’ understanding of the limitations of particular sources and help us develop better research designs in the future.},

"centuries. By egalitarian, I refer to an ideal of social relations. To be an egalitarian is to commend and promote a society in which its members interact as equals." (Anderson 2017:4)
"three types or dimensions of social hierarchy: of authority, esteem, and standing." (Anderson 2017:4)
"contrasting market exchange with begging, a kind of gift exchange in which subordinate parties offer tokens of asymmetrical esteem" (Anderson 2017:5)
"The resort to servile fawning supposes that one's interests have negligible standing in the eyes of the other" (Anderson 2017:5)
"Behind every gift exchange, ostensibly an altruistic affair, lurks dependency, contempt, and subordination" (Anderson 2017:5)
"The action of real importance takes place once the contract is signed and the time comes to execute it." (Anderson 2017:6)
"The performance of the contract embodies a profound asymmetry in whose interests count: henceforth, the worker will be required to toil under conditions that pay no regard to his interests, and every regard for the capitalist's profit." (Anderson 2017:6)
"Without a sympathetic appreciation for what might interest the other in transacting with oneself, and without acknowledging the independent standing of the other as someone whose property rights must be respected, no bargain will be struck" (Anderson 2017:6)
"The Industrial Revolution was a cataclysmic event for egalitarians, a fundamental turning point in egalitarian social thought" (Anderson 2017:7)
"public discourse is underequipped to cope with these challenges" (Anderson 2017:7)
"We are told that our choice is between free markets and state control, when most adults live their working lives under a third thing entirely: private government." (Anderson 2017:7)
"Egalitarianism, more fundamentally, is about dismantling or taming social hierarchy" (Anderson 2017:9)
"Government was everywhere, not just in the hands of the organizations we identify today with the modern state." (Anderson 2017:9)
"The central religious conflict of the English Civil War was over church governance: the Puritans wanted to overthrow the Anglican bishops and universalize the Presbyterian system of governance by elders." (Anderson 2017:13)
"The personal independence of masterless men and women in matters of thought and religion depended on their independence in matters of property and trade." (Anderson 2017:15)
"arbitrar y private government." (Anderson 2017:16)
"observations, in the order of esteem and standing, earning one's living is better than begging" (Anderson 2017:16)
"supported property rights and free trade for the ways they secured and promoted the personal independence of individuals from the domination of others. These institutions promoted the ability of men and women to become masterless, and increased the dignity and bargaining power of those who remained servants, by raising their wages and real incomes and by lifting beggars from destitution to employment." (Anderson 2017:17)
"A tenant at will . . . is as dependent upon the proprietor as any servant or retainer whatever, and must obey him with as little reserve" (Anderson 2017:19)
""hospitality" is given in return for obedience. The result is private government: the giftgiver's unaccountable dominion over the recipients of his good will. But private government was bad government." (Anderson 2017:20)
"labor radicals saw access to selfemployment as central to avoiding poverty and attaining standing as equals in society." (Anderson 2017:26)
"When the bulk of the population is selfemployed, pleading for relief from state meddling is quite a different proposition than it would be today." (Anderson 2017:28)
""Agrarian Justice" (Anderson 2017:29)
"The great defect of such a system is that it makes families depend on labor to avoid poverty. What happens when, due to old age, disability, illness, or death, there is no one in the family able to work?" (Anderson 2017:29)
"Paine proposed a system of universal social insurance, including oldage pensions, survivor benefits, and disability payments for families whose members could not work." (Anderson 2017:29)
"Revenues for social insurance would come from an inheritance tax, which in his day amounted to a land tax." (Anderson 2017:30)
"By this reasoning, Paine justified social insurance as a universal right, not a charity" (Anderson 2017:30)
"What began as a hopeful, inspiring egalitarian ideal in the United States selfdestructed in three ways." (Anderson 2017:32)
"First, the ideal of universal selfemployment never managed to incorporate the unpaid domestic labor essential to family life," (Anderson 2017:33)
"contained an implicit esteem hierarchy that was ultimately to turn its egalitarian aspirations upside down" (Anderson 2017:33)
"blaming those left standing in a game of musical chairs, while denying that the structure of the game has anything to do with the outcome." (Anderson 2017:34)
"Mental labor was separated from manual labor," (Anderson 2017:35)
"the Industrial Revolution. Their model of how to bring about a free society of equals through free markets via nearuniversal selfemployment was shattered. Advocates of laissez faire, who blithely applied the earlier arguments for market society to a social context that brought about the very opposite of the effects that were predicted and celebrated by their predecessors, failed to recognize that the older arguments no longer applied. Thus arose a symbiotic relationship between libertarianism and authoritarianism that blights our political discourse to this day. For what we have yet to adequately grasp is the nature of the challenge before us: private government." (Anderson 2017:37)},

"government exists wherever some have the authority to issue orders to others, backed by sanctions, in one or more domains of life" (Anderson 2017:7)
"If something is legitimately kept private from you, that means it is none of your business. This entails at least one of the following: you are not entitled to know about it, your interests have no standing in decisions regarding it, you aren't entitled to make decisions regarding it or to hold those who do accountable for the effect their decisions have on you." (Anderson 2017:8)
"private to you, that means it is your business, and you may exclude others from making it any of theirs." (Anderson 2017:8)
"you are entitled to keep others from knowing about it; you need not consider others' interests in making decisions regarding it; you are not accountable to others for your decisions regarding it; you are entitled to exclude others from making decisions regarding it." (Anderson 2017:8)
"public, that means it is the business of a more or less welldefined group of people (members of the public), such that no one is entitled to exclude any member of the group from making it their business." (Anderson 2017:8)
"Publicity in the informational sense typically extends much further than publicity with respect to standing, decision making, and accountability" (Anderson 2017:8)
"latter three categories refer to the governance of" (Anderson 2017:8)
"public status, with respect to governance, involves means by which the public asserts standing to make claims regarding its governance, and organizes itself to make collective decisions regarding it, and/or hold accountable the individuals elected or appointed to make such decisions." (Anderson 2017:8)
"Privacy is relative to person" (Anderson 2017:8)
"follows that there is no single public sphere or a single private sphere in society." (Anderson 2017:9)
"many spheres, and which are public or private depends on who you are" (Anderson 2017:9)
"the association of the state with the public sphere is not inherent. It is a contingent social achievement of immense importance" (Anderson 2017:9)
"You are subject to private government wherever (1) you are subordinate to authorities who can order you around and sanction you for not complying over some" (Anderson 2017:9)
"domain of your life, and (2) the authorities treat it as none of your business, across a wide range of cases, what orders it issues or why it sanctions you." (Anderson 2017:10)
"government is private with respect to a subject if it can issue orders, backed by sanctions, to that subject in some domain of that subject's life, and that subject has no say in how that government operates and no standing to demand that their interests be taken into account, other than perhaps in narrowly defined circumstances, in the decisions that government makes." (Anderson 2017:10)
"the privacy of a government is defined relative to the governed, not relative to the state" (Anderson 2017:10)
"legal entities that are private in relation to the state." (Anderson 2017:10)
"t abstracts from the people who are governed and their relation to these governments." (Anderson 2017:10)
"My definition of private government focuses on the fact that, in many of these governments, the governed are kept out of decision-making as well." (Anderson 2017:10)
"But there are at least three concepts of freedom: negative, positive, and republican." (Anderson 2017:10)
"negative freedom, no one is interfering with your actions." (Anderson 2017:10)
"positive freedom, you have a rich menu of options effectively accessible to you, given your resources" (Anderson 2017:10)
"republican freedom, no one is dominating you— you are subject" (Anderson 2017:10)
"to no one's arbitrary, unaccountable will.1" (Anderson 2017:11)
"All three kinds of freedom are valuable. There are sound reasons to make tradeoffs among them." (Anderson 2017:11)
"this is to confuse negative liberties with exclusive rights" (Anderson 2017:11)
"positive liberties— are vastly greater with the establishment of a system of property rights." (Anderson 2017:11)
"Every establishment of a private property right entails a correlative duty, coercively enforceable by individuals or the state, that others refrain from meddling with another's property without the owner's permission" (Anderson 2017:12)
"Private property rights thus entail massive net losses in negative liberty, relative to the state of maximum negative liberty." (Anderson 2017:12)
"If we are good libertarians and insist that the justification of any constraint on liberty must appeal to some other more important liberty, then the libertarian case for private property depends on accepting that positive liberty very often rightly overrides negative liberty. It follows that even massive state constraints on negative liberty (in the form of enforcements of private property rights) can increase total liberty (in an accounting that weights positive liberty more highly than negative, as any accounting that can justify private property in terms of freedom must)" (Anderson 2017:12)
"Private government is, thus, a perfectly coherent concep" (Anderson 2017:13)
"reject the false narrowing of the scope of government to the state, recognize that one's liberty can be constrained by private governors in domains of activity kept private from the state, and that increased state constraints on people's negative liberties can generate massive net gains in individual positive and republican freedoms." (Anderson 2017:13)
"theor y of the firm contains important insights into the organization of production in advanced economies. However, it fails to explain the sweeping scope of authority that employers have over workers. What is worse, its practitioners sometimes even deny that workers lie under the authority of their bosses, in terms that reflect and reinforce an illusion of workers' freedom that also characterizes much of public discourse." (Anderson 2017:15)
"promarket egalitarian dream failed in part due to economies of scale" (Anderson 2017:15)
"economies of scale do not explain why production is not managed by independent contractors acting without external supervision, who rent their capital." (Anderson 2017:16)
"According to the theory of the firm, this is due to the excessive costs of contracting between suppliers of factors of production" (Anderson 2017:16)
"the key to the superior efficiency of hierarchy is the openended authority of managers. It is impossible to specify in advance all of the contingencies that may require an alteration in an initial understanding of what a worker must do. Efficient employment contracts are there fore necessarily incomplete: they do not specify precisely everything a worker might be asked to do." (Anderson 2017:17)
"This suggests that the limits of the employer's powers are an object of negotiation or at least communication between the parties. In the vast majority of cases, outside the contexts of collective bargaining or for higherlevel employees, this is not true. Most workers are hired without any negotiation over the content of the employer's authority, and without a written or oral contract specifying any limits to it." (Anderson 2017:18)
"What, then, determines the scope and limits of the employer's authority, if it is not a meeting of minds of the parties?" (Anderson 2017:18)
"The state does so, through a complex system of laws— not only labor law, but laws regulating corporate governance, workplace safety, fringe benefits, discrimination, and other matters." (Anderson 2017:18)
"Under the employmentatwill baseline, workers, in effect, cede all of their rights to their employers, except those specifically guaranteed to them by law, for the duration of the" (Anderson 2017:18)
"employment relationship. E" (Anderson 2017:19)
"sweeping, arbitrary, and unaccountable— not subject to notice, process, or appeal. The state has established the constitution of the government of the workplace: it is a form of private government." (Anderson 2017:19)
"Alchian and Demsetz appear to be claiming that wherever individuals are free to exit a relationship, authority cannot exist within it. This is like saying that Mussolini was not a dictator, because Italians could emigrate." (Anderson 2017:20)
"While emigration rights may give governors an interest in voluntarily restraining their power, such rights hardly dissolve i" (Anderson 2017:20)
"managers have numerous other sanctions at their disposal besides firing and suing" (Anderson 2017:20)
"Perhaps the thought is that where consent mediates the relationship between the parties, the relationship cannot be one of subordination to authority. That would be a surprise to the entire social contract tradition, which is precisely about how the people can consent to government." (Anderson 2017:20)
"Alchian and Demsetz may be hoodwinked by the superficial symmetry of the employment contract: under employmentatwill, workers, too, may quit for any or no reason. This leads them to represent quitting as equivalent to firing one's boss. But workers have no power to remove the boss from his position within the firm. And quitting often imposes even greater costs on workers than being fired does, for it makes them ineligible for unemployment insurance" (Anderson 2017:21)
"Threats, to be effective, need to be credible." (Anderson 2017:21)
"It is an odd kind of countervailing power that workers supposedly have to check their bosses' power, when they typically suffer more from imposing it than they would suffer from the worst sanction bosses can impose on them." (Anderson 2017:21)
"public discourse too, tend to represent employees as if they were independent contractors" (Anderson 2017:22)
"sold; in purchasing command over labor, employers purchase command over people." (Anderson 2017:22)
"People continue to deploy the same justification of market society— that it would secure the personal independence of workers from arbitrary authority— long after it failed to deliver on its original aspiration." (Anderson 2017:22)
"a large class of libertarianleaning thinkers and politicians, with considerable public following, cannot perceive half of the economy: they cannot perceive the half that takes place beyond the market, after the employment contract is accepted." (Anderson 2017:23)
"limiting their focus to the entry and exit conditions of the labor contract, while blackboxing what actually went on in the factories" (Anderson 2017:23)
"governments. Laissezfaire liberals, touting the freedom of the free market, told workers: choose your Leviathan. That is like telling the citizens of the Communist bloc of Eastern Europe that their freedom could be secured by a right to emigrate to any country— as long as they stayed behind the Iron Curtain." (Anderson 2017:25)
"Every competitive equilibrium is established against a background assignment of property rights and other rights established by the state." (Anderson 2017:25)
"Consent to an option within a set cannot justify the option set itself." (Anderson 2017:26)
"The evolving rhetoric of laissezfaire liberalism that arose in the nineteenth century papered over the real issues and represented, in Orwellian fashion, subjection as freedom." (Anderson 2017:27)
"public and academic discourse has largely lost sight of the problem that organized workers in the nineteenth century saw clearly: the pervasiveness of private government at work. Here most of us are, toiling under the authority of communist dictators, and we do not see the reality for what it is." (Anderson 2017:27)
"25 percent of employees who understand that they are subject to dictatorship at work" (Anderson 2017:28)
"and the other 55 percent or so who are neither securely selfemployed nor upperlevel managers, nor the tiny elite tier of nonmanagerial stars (athletes, entertainers, superstar academics) who have the power to dictate employment contracts to their specification, nor even the evershrinking class of workers under everretrenching collective bargaining agreements." (Anderson 2017:28)
"liberty. They work in a state of republican unfreedom, their liberties vulnerable to cancellation without justification, notice, process, or appeal. That they enjoy substantially greater negative liberty than they are legally entitled to no more justifies their lack of republican liberty than the fact that most wives enjoyed greater freedoms than they were legally entitled to justified coverture— or even coverture modified by free divorce." (Anderson 2017:29)
"the theory of the firm, although it explains the necessity of hierarchy, neither explains nor justifies private government in the workplace." (Anderson 2017:29)
"That the constitution of workplace government is both arbitrary and dictatorial is not dictated by efficiency or freedom of contract, but rather by the state." (Anderson 2017:29)
"In other words, in the great contest between individualism and collectivism regarding the mode of production, collectivism won, decisively" (Anderson 2017:30)
"That advocates of capitalism continue to speak as if their preferred system of production upholds "individualism" is simply a symptom of institutional hemiagnosia, the misdeployment of a hopeful preindustrial vision of what market society would deliver as if it described our current reality, which replaces market relations with governance relations across wide domains of production." (Anderson 2017:30)
"If government is inescapable or necessary for solving certain important problems, the only way to make people free under that government is to make that government a public thing, accountable to the governed. The task is to replace private government with public government." (Anderson 2017:30)
"There are four general strategies for advancing and protecting the liberties and interests of the governed under any type of government: (1) exit, (2) the rule of" (Anderson 2017:30)
"law, (3) substantive constitutional rights, and (4) voice. Let us consider each in turn." (Anderson 2017:31)
"other contractual barriers to exit are common and growing." (Anderson 2017:31)
"There should be a strong legal presumption against such barriers to exit, to protect workers' freedom to exit their employers' government." (Anderson 2017:31)
"The rule of law is a complex ideal encompassing several protections of subjects' liberties: (a) Authority may be exercised only through laws duly passed and publicized in advance, rather than arbitrary orders issued without any process. (b) Sub jects are at liberty to do anything not specifically pro-" (Anderson 2017:31)
"hibited by law. (c) Laws are generally applicable to everyone in similar circumstances. (d) Subjects have rights of due process before suffering any sanctions for noncompliance." (Anderson 2017:32)
"obstacles to applying ruleoflaw protections in the workplace empower employers to abuse their authority, subject workers to humiliating treatment, and impose excessive constraints on their freedom." (Anderson 2017:32)
"akin to a bill of rights against employers." (Anderson 2017:33)
"there is no adequate substitute for recognizing workers' voice in their government. Voice can more readily adapt workplace rules to local conditions than state regulations can, while incorporating respect for workers' freedom, interests, and dignity. J" (Anderson 2017:34)
"design a workplace constitution in which workers have a nonadversarial voice in workplace governance, without raising concerns about monopolization" (Anderson 2017:35)},

	abstract = {Governments are charged with monitoring citizens’ compliance with prescribed behavioral standards and punishing noncompliance. Flaws in information available to enforcing agents, however, may lead to subsequent enforcement errors, eroding government authority and undermining incentives for compliance. We explore these concepts in a laboratory experiment. A “monitor” player makes punishment decisions after receiving noisy signals about other players’ choices to contribute to a public good. We find that the possibility of wrongly accusatory signals has a more deleterious effect on contribution levels than the possibility of wrongly exculpatory signals. We trace this across-treatment difference to a “false positives trap”: when members of a largely compliant population are sometimes incorrectly accused, some will be unjustly punished if enforcement power is employed, but non-compliant individuals will escape punishment if that power is abdicated. Either kind of error discourages compliance. An additional treatment demonstrates that the functioning of a given enforcement institution may vary, depending on its origins. We consider implications of our findings for theories of deterrence, fairness, and institutional legitimacy.},

Explicit prejudice, a direct measure based in beliefs about the group-level inferiority of Blacks, is used less frequently. We investigate whether these attitudes predict anti-Black discrimination and evaluations of the fairness of intergroup inequality. Study 1 used the Ultimatum Game to obtain a behavioral measure of racial discrimination and found whites engaged in anti-Black discrimination. Explicit prejudice explained which whites discriminated, whereas resentment did not. In study 2, white third-party observers evaluated intergroup interactions in the Ultimatum Game, and explicit prejudice explained racially biased fairness evaluations, but resentment did not. This demonstrates that resentment and prejudice are distinct constructs and that explicit prejudice has clear behavioral implications. We also find that explicit prejudice is widespread among white Americans and significantly less partisan than resentment.},

Survey techniques are practically infeasible and selective samples provide no counterfactual. Assigning recruits to contextual units provides one solution, but is vulnerable to problems of ecological inference. In this article, we take inspiration from epidemiology and the protest literature and elaborate a technique to combine survey and ecological approaches. The rare events, multilevel Bayesian contaminated case-control design we propose accounts for individual-level and contextual factors, as well as spatial autocorrelation in the incidence of recruitment. We validate our approach by matching a sample of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters from nine Muslim-majority countries with representative population surveys enumerated shortly before recruits joined the movement. We find that high status individuals in their early twenties who had university education were more likely to join ISIS. We find more mixed evidence for relative deprivation.},

The reason to doubt such a comparison is that the linear specification appears to keep all observations, whereas the logit drops the groups where the dependent variable is either all zeros or all ones. This letter demonstrates that a linear specification averages the estimates for all the homogeneous outcome groups (which, by definition, all have slope coefficients of zero) with the slope coefficients for the groups with a mix of zeros and ones. The correct comparison of the linear to logit form is to only look at groups with some variation in the dependent variable. Researchers using the linear specification are urged to report results for all groups and for the subset of groups where the dependent variable varies. The interpretation of the difference between these two results depends upon assumptions which cannot be empirically assessed.},

The popular slider task in Gill and Prowse (Am Econ Rev 102(1):469–503, 2012) has been characterized as satisfying this requirement, and the task is increasingly used to investigate the response to incentives. However, a between-subject examination of the slider task’s response to incentives has not been conducted. We provide such an examination with three different piece-rate incentives: half a cent, two cents, and eight cents per slider completed. We find only a small increase in performance: despite a 1500 \% increase in the incentives, output only increases by 5 \%. With such an inelastic response we caution that for typical experimental sample sizes and incentives the slider task is unlikely to demonstrate a meaningful and statistically significant performance response.},

Yet these tools may fail to measure bias as intended because they are vulnerable to self-presentational concerns and/or fail to capture bias rooted in more automatic associative and affective reactions. We examine a set of misattribution-based approaches, adapted from social psychology, that may sidestep these concerns. Participants in Nairobi, Kenya completed a series of common economics games alongside versions of these misattribution tasks adapted for this setting, each designed to detect bias toward noncoethnics relative to coethnics. Several of the misattribution tasks show clear evidence of (expected) bias, arguably reflecting differences in positive/negative affect and heightened threat perception toward noncoethnics. The Dictator and Public Goods Games, by contrast, are unable to detect any bias in behavior toward noncoethnics versus coethnics. We conclude that researchers of ethnic and other biases may benefit from including misattribution-based procedures in their tool kits to widen the set of biases to which their investigations are sensitive.},

	abstract = {This article is the fifth in a series to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the ILR Review. The series features articles that analyze the state of research and future directions for important themes this journal has featured over many years of publication., The decline in unionization experienced in the United States over the past 40 years raises a question of fundamental importance to workers, society, and the field of industrial relations: Have workers lost interest in having a voice at work, or is there a gap between workers’ expectations for a voice and what they actually experience? And if a “voice gap” exists, what options are available to workers to close that gap? The authors draw on a nationally representative survey of workers that both updates previous surveys conducted in 1977 and 1995 and goes beyond the scope of these previous efforts to consider a wider array of workplace issues and voice options. Results indicate that workers believe they should have a voice on a broad set of workplace issues, but substantial gaps exist between their expected and their actual level of voice at work. Nearly 50\% of non-union workers say they would vote for a union, compared to approximately one-third in the two prior national surveys, which points to continued interest in unions as a voice mechanism. Additionally, the authors find significant variation in the rates of use of different voice options and workers’ satisfaction with those options. The results suggest that a sizable voice gap exists in American workplaces today, but at the same time, no one voice option fits all workers or all issues.},

Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize. Better understanding when and where trade is costly, and how and why it may be beneficial, is a key item on the research agenda for trade and labor economists.},

This paper aims to add to the discussion on how to promote workers’ economic mobility through improving job quality. Definitions of what constitutes a “good job” vary—including adequate wages, benefits, stable schedules, worker protections, positive work environments, potential for advancement, and other features. In this report, we examine definitions and evidence on good jobs, with a focus on elements of jobs that might support economic mobility. We develop a framework for defining good jobs, drawing from different definitions of job quality in the literature. Then we use this framework to organize a review of the evidence on links between elements of good jobs and worker well-being, focusing on elements of jobs that might support worker mobility. We find that job quality definitions vary significantly in their complexity. There is evidence indicating relationships between job elements and worker well-being (variously defined), though the depth and conclusiveness of research vary in important ways. Research connecting job elements to economic mobility is more limited. This report is part of a larger effort to examine the ways additional research and data can support understanding of the role of job quality in worker mobility.},

We engage 745 individuals in a field experiment with three arms: (1) a control arm, (2) a weekly cash arm, and (3) a gainful employment arm, in which work is offered and individuals are paid weekly the approximate equivalent of that in the cash arm. We find that employment confers significant psychosocial benefits beyond the impacts of cash alone, with effects concentrated among males. The cash arm does not improve psychosocial wellbeing, despite the provision of cash at a weekly amount that is more than twice the amount held by recipients in savings at baseline. Consistent with these findings, we find that 66\% of those in our work treatment are willing to forego cash payments to instead work for free. Our results have implications for social protection policies for the unemployed in low income countries and refugee populations globally.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence documents an increased interest among American workers in joining a union. At the same time, there is revived debate among labor scholars, union leaders, politicians, and activists over what forms of labor representation are best suited to meet the needs of the contemporary workforce. Yet little is known about what contemporary workers have to say about these debates. This article draws on a conjoint survey experiment fielded on a nationally representative sample of more than 4,000 employees to explore the forms of representation workers want and are willing to support by paying dues. The authors compare interest in the forms of labor representation that are currently being debated. Results show that while workers value traditional collective bargaining, they would be even more willing to join and financially support organizations currently unavailable under US law and practice. The authors use these results to draw implications for the labor movement, worker advocacy groups, and the future of labor law.},

	abstract = {Local social interactions among individuals in animal groups generate collective behavior, allowing groups to adjust to changing conditions. Historically, scientists from different disciplines have taken different approaches to modeling collective behavior. We describe how each can contribute to the goal of understanding natural systems. Simple models rooted in physics have demonstrated that local interactions far from equilibrium can generate collective states. However, such simple models are not generic and may not fully describe the real biology. Other classes of models that are more akin to engineering descriptions have been proposed for groups where the function of the collective behavior is better understood. However, such models cannot necessarily explain why or how such functions emerge from first principles. We argue that to bring these distinct modeling approaches together, models of collective behavior should be formulated to address specific questions and to allow for validation against real biological systems. As examples, we discuss four forms of collective behavior that differ both in the interactions that produce the collective behavior and in ecological context, and thus require very different modeling frameworks. 1) Harvester ants use local interactions consisting of brief antennal contact, in which one ant assesses the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of another, to regulate foraging activity, which can be modeled as a closed-loop excitable system. 2) Arboreal turtle ants form trail networks in the canopy of the tropical forest, using trail pheromone; one ant detects the volatile chemical that another has recently deposited. The process that maintains and repairs the trail, which can be modeled as a distributed algorithm, is constrained by the physical configuration of the network of vegetation in which they travel. 3) Swarms of midges interact acoustically and non-locally, and can be well described as agents moving in an emergent potential well that is representative of the swarm as a whole rather than individuals. 4) Flocks of jackdaws change their effective interactions depending on ecological context, using topological distance when traveling but metric distance when mobbing. We discuss how different research questions about these systems have led to different modeling approaches.},

The authors contribute to recent advances in the literature that have highlighted the role of economic threat for understanding the support of radical-right parties. In contrast to existing work, the authors do not treat voters as atomistic individuals; they instead investigate households as a crucial site of preference formation. Combining largescale labor market data with comparative survey data, they confirm the expectations of their theoretical framework by demonstrating that the effect of occupational unemployment risk on radical-right support is strongly conditioned by household-risk constellations. Voting for the radical right is a function not only of a voter’s own risk, but also of his or her partner’s risk. The article provides additional evidence on the extent to which these effects are gendered and on the mechanisms that link household risk and party choice. The results imply that much of the existing literature on individual risk exposure potentially underestimates its effect on political behavior due to the neglect of multiplier effects within households.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effects of economic distress on support for radical right parties. Using Swedish election data, I show that one layoff notice among low-skilled native-born workers increases, on average, support for the Swedish radical right party the Sweden Democrats by 0.17–0.45 votes. The relationship between layoff notices and support for the Sweden Democrats is stronger in areas with a high share of low-skilled immigrants and in areas with a low share of high-skilled immigrants. These findings are in line with theories suggesting that economically distressed voters oppose immigration as they fear increased labor market competition. In addition, I use individual-level survey data to show that self-reported unemployment risk is positively associated with voting for the Sweden Democrats among low-skilled respondents while the opposite is true for high-skilled respondents, echoing the aggregate-level findings.},

Platform power inheres in companies of economic scale that provide the terms of access through which large numbers of consumers access goods, services, and information. Firms with platform power benefit from a deference from policymakers, but this deference is not primarily a function of direct influence through lobbying or campaign contributions, nor does it come from the threat of disinvestment. Companies with platform power instead benefit from the tacit allegiance of consumers, who can prove a formidable source of opposition to regulations that threaten these platforms. Focusing on the critical role played by consumers in explaining the powers platform firms wield in the rich democracies lends insight as well into their distinctive vulnerabilities, which flow from events that split the consumer–platform alliance or that cue citizen, as opposed to consumer, political identities.},

(Culpepper and Thelen 2020:290)"today's tech firms enjoy a direct, indeed virtually unmediated, link to their users, most of whom connect to these firms through devices they carry in their pockets every day." (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:294)"What is distinctive and distinctively powerful, however, is the combination of these features. To put it somewhat crudely: consumers depended on U.S. Steel, which exercised infrastructural power, but they did not love the company or actively appreciate the advantages (if any) that it afforded them. By contrast, consumers love Lego but they are not dependent on the company in the same way that they are dependent on, say, Amazon, which actually allows them to order their Legos without having to change out of their pajamas. The platform in platform power thereby does important work for these companies." (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:296)"If platform firms have consumers as their natural allies, how do they ever lose regulatory battles? Our theoretical position draws on the priming literature in social science, which posits that individuals have multiple identities, the salience of which can influence their political preferences on a given political issue. Most notably, we are all citizens and consumers. Priming citizen identity can lead to more sociotropic preferences, while priming consumer identity can lead to a narrower focus on individual self-interest." (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:299)"We expect a breakdown of the new permissive consensus in two sorts of situations. The first is one in which a political issue becomes framed in ways that directly pit the interests of the consumer against the interests of the platform companies. The second situation in which the permissive consensus will collapse is one in which political events prime consumers to think of themselves as citizens first, with the sociotropic concerns of citizens, as opposed to consumers first" (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:300)"we therefore expect platform companies to regard appeals to the broader public to be much more attractive than they typically are for nonplatform companies." (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:301)"platform companies are more likely than non-platform companies to engage in broad-based political campaigns, pitting their popularity against those of their opponents" (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:301)"Where independent bureaucratic agencies or courts regulate platforms, those bodies are by design more politically insulated from popular influence. We expect this insulation to diminish the influence of platform power in front of regulators such as the European Competition Network." (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:302)"Thus it matters whether a platform service is consumed by locals (as in the case of Uber) or instead by visitors (Airbnb) to whom local politicians may not feel particularly beholden" (Culpepper and Thelen 2020:309)},

It also represents a convergence of different fields with different ways of thinking about and doing science. The goal of this Perspective is to provide some clarity around how these approaches differ from one another and to propose how they might be productively integrated. Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions—the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes—and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.},

these false and unsupported beliefs, which seem to be genuinely held by many people? Though limits on cognitive resources and attention play an important role, many 
of the most destructive misperceptions arise in domains where individuals have weak incentives to hold accurate beliefs and strong directional motivations to endorse 
beliefs that are consistent with a group identity such as partisanship. These tendencies are often exploited by elites who frequently create and amplify misperceptions to 
influence elections and public policy. Though evidence is lacking for claims of a "post-truth" era, changes in the speed with which false information travels and the extent 
to which it can find receptive audiences require new approaches to counter misinformation. Reducing the propagation and influence of false claims will require further 
efforts to inoculate people in advance of exposure (for example, media literacy), debunk false claims that are already salient or widespread (for example, fact-checking), 
reduce the prevalence of low-quality information (for example, changing social media algorithms), and discourage elites from promoting false information (for example, 
strengthening reputational sanctions).},

We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the political roots of the global rise in corporate savings. In recent years, ﬁrms throughout advanced economies have started to accumulate enormous savings. Instead of using their revenues to reinvest or raise wages, many companies now stash their proﬁts within ﬁnancial markets, contributing to sluggish growth, ﬁnancial fragilities and rising inequality. I argue that political institutions that determine the balance-of-power between ﬁrms and employees play an important role in shaping this trend. The stronger unions are, the more they pressure ﬁrms into using revenues for pay increases and investment. The more their inﬂuence erodes, the stronger the rise of savings. Using panel data from 25 OECD countries as well as a regression discontinuity design leveraging the German law on co-determination, I ﬁnd robust and causal evidence supporting this claim. These results have implications for our broader understanding of how political institutions aﬀect ﬁnancial imbalances and economic inequality.},

	abstract = {Both Marxist and neo-classical theories of income distribution agree that the worker is exploited if he gets less than he produces. They differ over the imputation to the worker of 'his' product, Marxists using the average and neoclassical theorists the marginal product. In order to bring out the deeper reasons behind this difference, the following notions and theories are invoked: the fallacy of composition, permitting the capitalist to treat each worker as if he were the marginal worker; the alienation of the worker from the capital goods which are the product of past labour; the capital controversy and the doubts that have been raised about the notion of aggregate capital; and Robert Nozick's distinction between end-result principles and historical principles in ethical theory.
            Pre-capitalist societies and advanced capitalist societies require a different conceptual frame work than the exploitation theory developed by Marx for classical capitalism. In these societies power relations and strategic interaction are more important than the anonymous exploitation through the market mechanism. Kelvin Lancaster's view of capitalism as a differential game between workers and capitalists provides an insight into modern capitalism that is more adequate than the Marxist model.},

We provide a Bayesian framework for understanding how researchers should approach the general problem of inferring causal effects from potentially biased research designs. Our core contention is that any sincere claim that a research design contains bias entails a belief about what that bias is. Once this belief is specified (along with a prior belief about the causal effect), what one should learn from a potentially biased estimate can be derived from Bayes’s rule. We apply this principle to explore when we should learn more or less from basic difference of means estimates and then extend our analysis to speak to several methodological debates and practical problems confronting applied researchers.},

"production takes place in a global value chain, where a series of complementary tasks can be outsourced to a low-cost country.

"With decentralised bargaining, unions will not coordinate their wage setting, so one union will not take into account the effects of its wage policy on other unionised workers." (Lommerud et al 2021:77)
"this means that the wage increase following outsourcing will be even higher than in the centralised case." (Lommerud et al 2021:77)

"The timing assumptions of the model imply that choices concerning organisational structure are more long-term than wage settlements." (Lommerud et al 2021:77)
"the degree to which a union cares more for employment or for wages is exogenous and uninfluenced by whether bargaining is centralised or not" (Lommerud et al 2021:77)
"The beneficial effects of decentralisation of bargaining in the face of possible outsourcing, found in our work, build on unions being relatively employment-oriented." (Lommerud et al 2021:77)

We also observe small aggregate levels of under-reports for others and a strong positive correlation across rounds in the reports for others, which might be explained by a coexistence of altruistic liars and spiteful liars in our population. Behavior is similar across ages, except for middle schoolers who exhibit a slightly higher inclination towards self-serving and spiteful lying. A focused analysis of choice in middle school reveals some differences by academic performance and socioeconomic status.},

This is a step in the right direction because mediation analyses based on nonexperimental data are likely to be biased and because experiments, in principle, provide a sound basis for causal inference. But even experiments cannot overcome certain threats to inference that arise chiefly or exclusively in the context of mediation analysis—threats that have received little attention in psychology. The authors describe 3 of these threats and suggest ways to improve the exposition and design of mediation tests. Their conclusion is that inference about mediators is far more difficult than previous research suggests and is best tackled by an experimental research program that is specifically designed to address the challenges of mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {In this short paper I oﬀer conceptualizations of history, theory, and their interplay under the aegis of political economy. My primary argument is that historical political economy (HPE) depends on theory for its success. First, notwithstanding empirical causal identiﬁcation, causal explanation is impossible without theory. Second, establishing causal uniqueness (that a particular mechanism is the only reasonable candidate to explain a case) and causal generalization (that a particular mechanism explains other cases not yet empirically analyzed) are exclusively theoretical in nature. No research design, however rigorous or credible, can support these claims; thus it is counterproductive for HPE scholars to analyze cases simply because causal identiﬁcation is possible. I conclude that political economy can best contribute to historical understanding by applying mechanisms from this ﬁeld as candidate explanations of important cases, and history can contribute to political economy by helping us discover new mechanisms.},

Political economists try to uncover this by exploring voters’ economic vulnerability, particularly the relationship between labor-market risk and redistribution preferences. Predominantly, however, such work imputes risk from occupational or sectoral characteristics. Due to within-occupational inequality in exposure to risk, considerable variation remains unexplored. I propose an individual-level, dynamic account of risk inferred from job tenure, contract type, and expectations of job security. These aspects, importantly, account for individual variation in risk and the possibility that one's experience of risk may change across time. The results indicate the usefulness of this approach to risk in understanding changes in social spending preferences.},

Inward Conquest presents the first comprehensive analysis of the political origins of modern public services during this period. Ansell and Lindvall show how struggles among political parties and religious groups shaped the structure of diverse yet crucially important public services, including policing, schooling, and public health. Liberals, Catholics, conservatives, socialists, and fascists all fought bitterly over both the provision and political control of public services, with profound consequences for contemporary political developments. Integrating data on the historical development of public order, education, and public health with novel measures on the ideological orientation of governments, the authors provide a wealth of new evidence on a missing link in the history of the modern state.},

	abstract = {I study how people understand, reason, and learn about two major tax policies: income taxation and estate taxation. I run large-scale online surveys and experiments on representative U.S. samples to elicit not only respondents’ factual knowledge about tax policy and the income or wealth distributions, but also their understanding of the mechanisms of tax policy and their reasoning about it. In decomposing policy views, I ﬁnd that support for income and estate taxes is most strongly correlated with social preferences, i.e., the perceived beneﬁts of redistribution and concerns around the fairness of inequality and taxation, as well as with views of the government. Eﬃciency concerns play a more minor role. These correlational patterns are conﬁrmed by the experimental approach, which shows people instructional videos that explain the workings and consequences of one of the aspects of tax policy (the “Redistribution” and the “Eﬃciency” treatments) or that bring the two together and focus on the trade-oﬀ (the “Economist” treatment). The Redistribution treatment and Economist treatments signiﬁcantly increase support for more progressive income or estate taxes, while the Eﬃciency treatment has no eﬀect. There are large partisan gaps, not just in the ﬁnal policy views, but also at every step of the reasoning about the underlying mechanisms of taxes. Democrats and Republicans’ divergences in tax policy views can ultimately be traced back to diﬀerent normative criteria (social preferences) and views of the government, rather than to diﬀerent perceptions of the eﬃciency implications of taxation.},

	abstract = {Political polarization and extremism are widely thought to be driven by the surge in economic inequality in many countries around the world. Understanding why inequality persists depends on knowing the causal effect of inequality on individual behavior. We study how inequality affects redistribution behavior in a randomized “give-or-take” experiment that created equality, advantageous inequality, or disadvantageous inequality between two individuals before offering one of them the opportunity to either take from or give to the other. We estimate the causal effect of inequality in representative samples of German and American citizens (n = 4,966) and establish two main findings. First, individuals imperfectly equalize payoffs: On average, respondents transfer 12\% of the available endowments to realize more equal wealth distributions. This means that respondents tolerate a considerable degree of inequality even in a setting in which there are no costs to redistribution. Second, redistribution behavior in response to disadvantageous and advantageous inequality is largely asymmetric: Individuals who take from those who are richer do not also tend to give to those who are poorer, and individuals who give to those who are poorer do not tend to take from those who are richer. These behavioral redistribution types correlate in meaningful ways with support for heavy taxes on the rich and the provision of welfare benefits for the poor. Consequently, it seems difficult to construct a majority coalition willing to back the type of government interventions needed to counter rising inequality.},

	abstract = {Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies.},

	abstract = {This book helps to explain why there is no adequate long-term care in America. Through a sweeping analytical narrative, from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession of today, Caring for America shows how law and social policy shaped home care into a low-waged job and a means-tested social service, stigmatized as part of public welfare, primarily funded through Medicaid, and relegated to the bottom of the medical hierarchy. It became a job for African American and immigrant women that kept them in poverty, while providing independence from institutionalization for needy elderly and disabled people. But while the state organized home care, it did not do so without contestation and confrontation. Caring for America also traces the intertwined, sometimes conflicting search of care providers and receivers for dignity, self-determination, security, and personal and social worth. It highlights social movements of senior citizens and disability rights/independent living, the civil rights organizing of women on welfare and domestic workers, the battles of public sector unions, and the unionization of health and service workers. It rethinks both the history of the American welfare state from the perspective of carework and the strategies of the U.S. labor movement in terms of a growing carework economy, arguing for care as a right deserving a living wage and social support.},

Meanwhile, as part of their larger battle for professional authority, and in order to define their work as distinct from menial labor, nurses sought to ensure that home aides would perform no health-related caregiving, but only housework and the like. In the emerging medical model, the authors argue, home aides’ services were deemed “informal, voluntary, and open-ended.”

Our ability to successfully adapt to such a diverse range of habitats is often explained in terms of our cognitive ability. Humans have relatively bigger brains and more computing power than other animals, and this allows us to figure out how to live in a wide range of environments. Here we argue that humans may be smarter than other creatures, but none of us is nearly smart enough to acquire all of the information necessary to survive in any single habitat. In even the simplest foraging societies, people depend on a vast array of tools, detailed bodies of local knowledge, and complex social arrangements and often do not understand why these tools, beliefs, and behaviors are adaptive. We owe our success to our uniquely developed ability to learn from others. This capacity enables humans to gradually accumulate information across generations and develop well-adapted tools, beliefs, and practices that are too complex for any single individual to invent during their lifetime.},

In these models, reciprocators punish noncooperation by with-holding future cooperation, and thus also penalize other cooperators in the group. Here, we analyze a model in which the response is some form of punishment that is directed solely at noncooperators. We refer to such alternative forms of punishment as retribution. We show that cooperation enforced by retribution can lead to the evolution of cooperation in two qualitatively different ways. (1) If benefits of cooperation to an individual are greater than the costs to a single individual of coercing the other n − 1 individuals to cooperate, then strategies which cooperate and punish noncooperators, strategies which cooperate only if punished, and, sometimes, strategies which cooperate but do not punish will coexist in the long run. (2) If the costs of being punished are large enough, moralistic strategies which cooperate, punish noncooperators, and punish those who do not punish noncooperators can be evolutionarily stable. We also show, however, that moralistic strategies can cause any individually costly behavior to be evolutionarily stable, whether or not it creates a group benefit.},

I argue that theories of the rise of care work in the U.S. economy explain key dynamics of job polarization—including robust growth at the bottom of the labor market and gender and racial differences in job growth—better than the alternative theories. By seeing care work as a distinctive form of labor, care work theories highlight different dimensions of economic restructuring than are emphasized in prior research on job polarization. I show that care work jobs contributed significantly and increasingly to job polarization from 1983 to 2007, growing at the top and bottom of the job structure but not at all in the middle. I close by considering whether the care economy will continue to reinforce job polarization, or whether it will provide new opportunities for revived growth in middle-wage jobs.},

A full appreciation of the need for comprehensive labor law reform requires an understanding of the serious shortcomings in current law and how they have been exploited over the years by employers resisting efforts by their workers to form unions. [togglable text="expand abstract"]

The go-to argument among the punditry and economists is that the decline is a simple manifestation of globalization and automation, essentially using the decline of manufacturing employment as the primary narrative for union decline.

In fact, automation and globalization affecting manufacturing can only explain a small share of the decline in union density. It is simple to note that union decline occurred in every sector within the private sector. The demand by workers for collective bargaining has mostly gone unmet, meaning the decline was not due to an erosion of interest by workers. The demand for collective bargaining is now at its highest level in many decades. Nor was union discrimination against women or minorities a factor, though such discrimination certainly existed in certain sectors. Nevertheless, there was an upsurge in interest in collective bargaining by black workers following the civil rights struggles and progress of the 1960s. By 1979, 34\% of black workers benefited from collective bargaining, substantially greater than the 25\% of white workers. Women were underrepresented in unions in 1979, but there were substantial efforts by women in retail and other services to organize in the 1970s that failed primarily because of employer opposition.

The narrative that needs to be told is the emergence of intense employer opposition and the development of new employer tactics abetted by changes in legal interpretations. The paper reviews the shifting landscape that led to the substantial decline in successful union organizing, which included: widespread use of anti-union consultants; threats of facility closings; the rise of illegal firings of union activists; the increasing inability to obtain a first contract even after a successful organizing campaign; the use of captive-audience meetings and screening of new hires to avoid union sympathizers; the empowering of "employer free speech"; and other developments. Other developments weakened union leverage in collective bargaining, such as: increased use of striker replacements; shutting down of union secondary boycott activity; increased use of offensive lockouts by employers; and artificial constraints on bargaining},

But moving beyond this aggregate relationship has proven difficult, in part because of limited microdata on union membership prior to 1973. We develop a new source of microdata on union membership dating back to 1936, survey data primarily from Gallup (N ≈ 980,000), to examine the long-run relationship between unions and inequality. We document dramatic changes in the demographics of union members: when density was at its mid-century peak, union households were much less educated and more nonwhite than other households, whereas pre-World War II and today they are more similar to nonunion households on these dimensions. However, despite large changes in composition and density since 1936, the household union premium holds relatively steady between 10 and 20 log points. We use our data to examine the effect of unions on income inequality. Using distributional decompositions, time series regressions, state-year regressions, as well as a new instrumental-variable strategy based on the 1935 legalization of unions and the World War II–era War Labor Board, we find consistent evidence that unions reduce inequality, explaining a significant share of the dramatic fall in inequality between the mid-1930s and late 1940s.},

Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92\% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the impact of unionization on involuntary job loss using establishment data from
the 1997 National Employer Survey (NES-II) and merging those data with contextual data at the industry
level as well as with local labor market data. The estimated logit models included information on
unionization rates and employment security provisions present in collective bargaining agreements as
factors influencing layoff rates for individual establishments, controlling for establishment size, firm
structure, use of non-regular employees, product/service demand and local employment. Results show
that the impact of unionization is not significant except for (1) establishments that operate in the nonmanufacturing sector; and (2) establishments operating in industries that have major collective
bargaining agreements which contain moderate employment security provisions. Under those conditions,
unionization decreases layoff rates; otherwise, unionization has no effect on layoff rates. These results
provide some evidence that unions may have placed increased emphasis on employment security in order
to protect members against involuntary job loss. This is in contrast to earlier studies which found a
positive relationship between unionization and layoffs. In addition, establishments in Right-to-Work
states have higher rates of involuntary job loss},

Interest is typically both in estimates at a given time and in changes between two successive time points. Calibration of the sample to force agreement with known population margins results in random weights being assigned to each response, but the usual methods of variance estimation do not account for this. This paper describes how resampling methods—the jackknife, jackknife linearization, balanced repeated replication and the bootstrap—can be used to do so. We also discuss issues of implementation, and we compare the methods by simulation based on data from the UK Labour Force Survey. The broad conclusions are these: bootstrap and jackknife linearization are less computer intensive than the other resampling methods for such applications and give better standard errors; ‘standard’ methods can be badly biased downwards; and it is essential to take variability of the weights into account.},

Much of the existing scholarship on illiberal regimes and authoritarian durability focuses on institutional explanations, but Tsai argues that, to better understand these issues, we need to examine public opinion and citizens' concerns about retributive justice. Government authorities uphold retributive justice - and are viewed by citizens as fair and committed to public good - when they affirm society's basic values by punishing wrongdoers who act against these values. Tsai argues that the production of retributive justice and moral order is a central function of the state and an important component of state building. Drawing on rich empirical evidence from in-depth fieldwork, original surveys, and innovative experiments, the book provides a new framework for understanding authoritarian resilience and democratic fragility.},

We use the enactment of right-to-work laws—which weaken unions by removing agency shop protections—to estimate the effect of unions on politics and policy from 1980-2016. Comparing counties on either side of a state and right-to-work border to causally identify the effects of the state laws, we find that right-to-work laws reduce Democratic Presidential vote shares by 3.5 percentage points. We find similar effects in Senate, House, and Gubernatorial races, as well as on state legislative control. Turnout is also 2 percentage points lower in right-to-work counties after passage. Exploring the mechanisms, we find that right-to-work laws dampen organized labor contributions to Democrats and that potential Democratic voters are less likely to be contacted to vote. The weakening of unions also has large downstream effects: fewer working-class candidates serve in state legislatures and Congress, while state policy moves in a more conservative direction.},

After controlling for established predictors of high school completion, demographic shifts, and coincident labor market changes unrelated to trade with China, we estimate that a movement from the 25th to the 75th percentile in Chinese import exposure led to an average increase in the graduation rate of 3.64 percentage points. Consistent with an environment in which students weigh increases in future earnings potential from further education against current labor market opportunities foregone, we find that growth in Chinese imports led to declines in wages for all educational groups, and reductions in employment for individuals without a high school degree both in absolute terms and relative to their more educated peers.},

	abstract = {The complexity of the American economy and polity has grown at an explosive rate in our era of globalization. Yet as the 2008 financial crisis revealed, the evolution of the American state has not proceeded apace. The crisis exposed the system's manifold political and economic dysfunctionalities. This book is a historically informed account of the American state's development from the 19th century to the present. It focuses in particular on the state-produced inequalities and administrative incoherence that became so apparent in the post-1970s era. The book offers an unsettling account of the growth of racial and economic inequality, the ossification of the state, the gradual erosion of democracy, and the problems deriving from imperial overreach. Utilizing the framework of sustainability, a concept that is currently informing some of the best work on governance and development, the chapters in this book show how the USA's current trajectory does not imply an impending collapse, but rather a gradual erosion of capacity and legitimacy. That is a more appropriate theoretical framework, the book contends, because for all of its manifest flaws, the American state is durable. That durability, however, does not preclude a long relative decline.},

"In other words, the presumption of racial homogeneity at home allowed for the construction of welfare systems with more forceful and authoritative means of connecting individual citizens to the state." (Lieberman 2003:31)
"where the boundaries of imperial and racial citizenship were more permeable, the possibilities for social policy were restricted by the possibility of racial inclusion. The presence of racial diversity withinrather than acrossnational boundaries changed the solidaristic imperatives of social politics, making the creation of centralized national welfare states rather more politically dangerous."

	abstract = {We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies—such as accommodative monetary policy—generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.},

"How did the twin phenomena of high debt levels and low interest rates come to be? Should there be a reconsideration of the standard macroeconomic toolkit of monetary and fiscal policy given the challenging environment of high debt levels and low interest rates? Is there a more prominent role for policies focused on redistribution?" (Mian et al :2)
"The framework shows how rising income inequality and the liberalization of the financial sector can push economies into a low interest rate-high debt environment. Traditional macroeconomic policies such as monetary and fiscal policy turn out to be less effective over the long term in such an environment. On the other hand, less standard policies such as macro-prudential regulation, redistribution policy, and policies addressing the structural sources of high inequality are more powerful and longlasting." (Mian et al :2)
"non-homothetic consumption-saving behavior" (Mian et al :2)
"into an otherwise conventional, deterministic two-agent endowment economy" (Mian et al :2)
"the saver in the model saves a larger fraction of lifetime income than the borrower." (Mian et al :2)
"the wealthy lend to the rest of the population, which makes household debt an important financial asset in the portfolio of the wealthy" (Mian et al :2)
"that large debt levels weigh negatively on aggregate demand: as borrowers reduce their spending to make debt payments to savers, the latter, having greater saving rates, only imperfectly offset the shortfall in borrowers' spending" (Mian et al :2)
"demand is depressed due to elevated debt levels as indebted demand." (Mian et al :2)
"shifts or policies that boost demand today through debt accumulation necessarily reduce demand going forward by shifting resources from borrowers to savers; therefore, such shifts or policies actually contribute to persistently low interest rates" (Mian et al :2)
"outcome: a rise in top income shares in the model shifts resources from borrowers to savers, pushing down interest rates due to savers' greater desire to save. Lower interest rates stimulate more debt, causing indebted demand—as debt is nothing other than an additional shift of resources in the form of debt service payments from borrowers to saver" (Mian et al :3)
"financial liberalization, which has been a prominent feature of advanced economies since the 1980s, leads to a decline in interest rates, a result that is difficult to generate in most macroeconomic models" (Mian et al :3)
"financial liberalization increases the amount of debt taken on by borrowers, which redistributes resources to savers. For the goods markets to clear, such a redistribution requires interest rates to fall given that savers have a lower marginal propensity to consume out of these larger debt payment" (Mian et al :3)
"secular forces such as rising inequality and financial liberalization can foster a large rise in households borrowing from other households. In both the model and the data, the household sector is crucial for understanding why debt levels have increased." (Mian et al :3)
"As long as some of the taxes are ultimately imposed on borrowers, deficit-financed government spending is similar to any policy which attempts to boost demand through debt accumulation. Ultimately, such a policy shifts resources from borrowers to savers, depressing aggregate demand and therefore interest rates in the long run." (Mian et al :3)
"an important channel of accommodative monetary policy operates through an increase in debt accumulation" (Mian et al :3)
"monetary policy has limited ammunition in the model: successive monetary policy interventions build up debt levels, thereby lowering natural rates. This forces policy rates to keep falling with them to avoid a recession, thus approaching the effective lower bound." (Mian et al :4)
"At that point, our economy is in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap, which is a well-defined stable steady state of our economy." (Mian et al :4)
"deficit spending, only work in the short run. Eventually, the economy is "pulled back" into the debt trap." (Mian et al :4)
"redistributive tax policies, such as wealth taxes, or structural policies that are geared towards reducing income inequality generate a sustainable increase in demand, persistently raising natural interest rates away from their effective lower bound." (Mian et al :4)
"Straub 2019)" (Mian et al :4)
"demand. It can act both as an amplifier of existing explanations—as we demonstrate for rising income inequality—or" (Mian et al :4)
"give rise to new explanations, as we demonstrate for financial liberalization, which is commonly thought to be a force against low interest rates." (Mian et al :5)
"The driving force behind this result is the specific structure and heterogeneity of preferences. It generates a higher saving rate of savers out of labor income, compared to borrowers, but a lower saving rate out of financial income." (Mian et al :5)
"The rise in debt has not been associated with a traditional channel through which businesses and the government borrow from the household sector to boost investment and productivity growth. Instead, rising debt levels appear to have been used to finance personal consumption )e expansion of credit has been used to increase (y motivating fact behind the model of indebted demand below." (Mian et al :9)
"That study focuses on the United States, and it shows that the rise in income inequality has generated a "saving glut of the rich," which has financed a substantial rise in household debt by the non-rich" (Mian et al :10)
"states with larger increases in income inequality since 1982 (as measured by their top 1\% income shares) have significantly larger increases in accumulated wealth relative to average state-level income." (Mian et al :12)
"When hi ( a) is increasing, marginal bequest utility decays more slowly than that of consumption, implying that wealthier agents have a stronger desire to save. This latter, non-homothetic case is the most plausible case intuitively and best supported case empirically as mentioned in Section 2.3 above. This is the case focused on by the model." (Mian et al :14)
"The central element in our theory are non-homothetic preferences, which lead to richer households having greater saving rates out of a permanent income transfer." (Mian et al :52)

Employers’ public opposition to unions yielded a scholarly consensus that US employers actively and consistently discriminate against union supporters. However, evidence for widespread employer anti-union discrimination is based mainly on employer reactions to rare union organizing campaigns. To measure baseline or preventive anti-union discrimination, the authors field the first ever US-based résumé correspondence study of employer responses to union supporter applicants. Focus is on entry-level, non-college degree jobs and findings show no difference in employer callback rates for union supporter applicants relative to non-union applicants. Drawing on interviews and survey data, the authors suggest that union weakness itself may have hollowed preventive employer discrimination against union supporters.},

Given the high return to attracting the median voter, why do vote-maximizing politicians take extreme positions? In this paper we find that strategic extremism depends on an intensive margin where politicians want to induce their core constituents to vote (or make donations) and the ability to target political messages toward those core constituents. Our model predicts that the political relevance of religious issues is highest when around one-half of the voting population attends church regularly. Using data from across the world and within the United States, we indeed find a nonmonotonic relationship between religious extremism and religious attendance.},

Hatred is fostered with stories of an out-group's crimes, but the impact of these stories comes from repetition not truth. Hate-creating stories are supplied by politicians when such actions help to discredit opponents whose policies benefit an out-group. Egalitarians foment hatred against rich minorities; opponents of re-distribution build hatred against poor minorities. Hatred relies on people accepting, rather than investigating, hate-creating stories. Hatred declines when there is private incentive to learn the truth. Increased economic interactions with a minority group may provide that incentive. This framework is used to illuminate the evolution of anti-Black hatred in the United States South, episodes of anti-Semitism in Europe, and the recent surge of anti-Americanism in the Arab world.},

But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of US news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this pro-rich bias emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media’s focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral patterns and demonstrate how distributional biases in the economy condition economic accountability.},

	abstract = {Humans sometimes cooperate to mutual advantage, and sometimes exploit one another. In industrialised societies, the prevalence of exploitation, in the form of crime, is related to the distribution of economic resources: more unequal societies tend to have higher crime, as well as lower social trust. We created a model of cooperation and exploitation to explore why this should be. Distinctively, our model features a desperation threshold, a level of resources below which it is extremely damaging to fall. Agents do not belong to fixed types, but condition their behaviour on their current resource level and the behaviour in the population around them. We show that the optimal action for individuals who are close to the desperation threshold is to exploit others. This remains true even in the presence of severe and probable punishment for exploitation, since successful exploitation is the quickest route out of desperation, whereas being punished does not make already desperate states much worse. Simulated populations with a sufficiently unequal distribution of resources rapidly evolve an equilibrium of low trust and zero cooperation: desperate individuals try to exploit, and non-desperate individuals avoid interaction altogether. Making the distribution of resources more equal or increasing social mobility is generally effective in producing a high cooperation, high trust equilibrium; increasing punishment severity is not.},

Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.},

For almost half a century, scholars have tried to test this assumption, finding little empirical support for a statistical relationship between the two variables. This article provides a critical review of this literature, starting out with the link between so-called vertical (inter-individual) inequality and conflict. I argue that the lack of empirical results can largely be attributed to the almost exclusive focus on individual-level differences in terms of income or land. Group identity is critical to recruitment and maintaining allegiance to a military organization. Hence, we should focus the attention on the relevant form of inequality?that between groups, or so-called horizontal inequalities. In contrast to the studies focusing on vertical inequality, an emerging quantitative literature on horizontal inequalities and conflict has found a positive link, which is more in line with the evidence from several case studies. However, measuring horizontal inequalities is a clear challenge, and there is a need for additional studies to qualify the initial findings. I conclude by suggesting some avenues for future research.},

This gap is larger than the differential job losses for women, African Americans, Hispanics, or workers without college degrees. Non-remote workers also experienced relatively worse respiratory health, which likely occurred because it was more difficult for non-remote workers to protect themselves. Grouping workers by pre-pandemic household income shows that job losses and, to a lesser extent, health losses were highest among non-remote workers from low-income households, exacerbating existing disparities. Finally, we show that lifting nonessential business closures did not substantially increase employment.},

While prior studies have examined the separate effects of inequality and immigration on redistribution preferences, the interaction between inequality and communal identity has been largely overlooked. This article explains that inequality triggers selective solidarity. Individuals exposed to inequality become more supportive of redistribution – but only if the redistribution benefits native-born citizens. Inequality therefore reinforces the already popular opinion that native citizens deserve welfare priority and widens the gap between support for natives and support for immigrants. This study first provides cross-national evidence with survey data linked to contextual socio-economic indicators from advanced industrialized countries. To evaluate causally identified effects, it then presents the results of a survey experiment administered to a nationally representative sample of Italian citizens. The findings imply that economic inequality can increase support for populist radical right parties that advocate discrimination in access to welfare services based on native citizenship.},

The electoral reform had an immediate effect on the fragmentation of the party system, due in part to strategic party entry. The authors find, though, that another main effect of the reform was that many voters switched between existing parties, particularly between the Liberals and Conservatives, as the incentives for these voters to coordinate against Labor were removed by the introduction of PR.},

Drift is a ubiquitous mode of policy change in America's gridlock-prone polity, and its causes are now well understood. Yet surprisingly little attention has been paid to the political consequences of drift—to the ways in which drift, like the adoption of new policies, may generate its own feedback effects. In this article, we seek to fill this gap. We first outline a set of theoretical expectations about how drift should affect downstream politics. We then examine these dynamics in the context of four policy domains: labor law, health care, welfare, and disability insurance. In each, drift is revealed to be both mobilizing and constraining: While it increases demands for policy innovation, group adaptation, and new group formation, it also delimits the range of possible paths forward. These reactions to drift, in turn, generate new problems, cleavages, and interest alignments that alter subsequent political trajectories. Whether formal policy revision or further stalemate results, these processes reveal key mechanisms through which American politics and policy develop.},

This article considers the impact of economic institutional arrangements on union membership trends in sixteen industrial democracies between 1960 and 1994. We find that the effects of economic globalization are marginal and conditional on particular economic institutions, which helps to explain divergent trends in union density among these countries.

	abstract = {During the early post-war period, Western trade-union movements grew in membership and achieved an institutionalized role in industrial relations and politics. However, during the last decades, many trade unions have seen their membership decline as they came increasingly under pressure due to social, economic, and political changes. This article reviews the main structural, cyclical, and institutional factors explaining union growth and decline. Concentrating on Western Europe, the empirical analysis compares cross-national union density data for 13 countries over the first period (1950-1975) and for 16 countries over the second.'crisis' period (1975-1995). The quantitative correlation and regression analysis indicates that structural and cyclical factors fail to explain the level and changes in unionization across Western Europe, while institutional variables fare better. In a second, qualitative comparative analysis, the authors stress the need to explain crossnational differences in the level or trend of unionization by a set of institutional arrangements: the access of unions to representation in the workplace; the availability of a selective incentive in the form of a union-administered unemployment scheme; recognition of employers through nationwide and sectoral corporatist institutions; and closed-shop arrangements for forced membership. Such institutional configurations support membership recruitment and membership retention, and define the conditions for the strategic choice of trade unions in responding to structural social-economic, political, and cultural changes.},

While globally the pandemic is at different stages and far from under control in some countries, now is the time for public health researchers and political scientists to start understanding how and why governments responded the way they have, explore how effective these responses appear to be, and what lessons we can draw about effective public health policymaking in preparation of the next wave of COVID-19 or the next infectious disease pandemic. We argue that there will be no way to understand the different responses to COVID-19 and their effects without understanding policy and politics. We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.},

Understanding Society is based on probability samples and the Covid-19 Study is constructed carefully to support valid population inferences. The Covid-19 Study collected novel data on the mitigation strategies that individuals and households employ. Further, prior observation of respondents in the panel allows us to characterize regressivity with respect to pre-pandemic economic positions. Our key findings are that those with precarious employment, aged under 30 and from minority ethnic groups faced the biggest labour market shocks. Almost 50\% of individuals have experienced declines in household earnings of at least 10\%, but declines are most severe in the bottom pre-pandemic income quintiles. Methods of mitigation vary substantially across groups: borrowing and transfers from family and friends are most prevalent among those most in need.},

We address this puzzle by analyzing the link between political mobilization and spending decisions at different levels of inequality and state capacity. Under high inequality and low levels of capacity, parties find it optimal to mobilize low-income voters via targeted goods. Yet, as capacity increases, targeted mobilization becomes a less effective strategy for voters’ mobilization. To evaluate the implications of this argument we exploit a quasi-natural experiment, the anticorruption audits by the Brazilian government. We show that an exogenous increase in monitoring effort by the state breaks the equilibrium around high participation of the poor and leads to a reduction in turnout, a reduction in the provision of targeted goods, and a decline in the likelihood of reelection by incumbents.},

This framework provides guidance for which causal effects are (and are not) needed for empirical welfare analysis of public policies. The key ingredient is the construction of each policy's marginal value of public funds (MVPF). The MVPF is the ratio of beneficiaries' willingness to pay for the policy to the net cost to the government. We discuss how the MVPF relates to "traditional" welfare analysis tools such as the marginal excess burden and marginal cost of public funds. We show how the MVPF can be used in practice by applying it to several canonical empirical applications from public finance, labor, development, trade, and industrial organization.},

	abstract = {We conduct a comparative welfare analysis of 133 historical policy changes over the past half-century in the United States, focusing on policies in social insurance, education and job training, taxes and cash transfers, and in-kind transfers. For each policy, we use existing causal estimates to calculate the benefit that each policy provides its recipients (measured as their willingness to pay) and the policy’s net cost, inclusive of long-term effects on the government’s budget. We divide the willingness to pay by the net cost to the government to form each policy’s Marginal Value of Public Funds, or its ``MVPF''. Comparing MVPFs across policies provides a unified method of assessing their effect on social welfare. Our results suggest that direct investments in low-income children’s health and education have historically had the highest MVPFs, on average exceeding 5. Many such policies have paid for themselves as the government recouped the cost of their initial expenditures through additional taxes collected and reduced transfers. We find large MVPFs for education and health policies among children of all ages, rather than observing diminishing marginal returns throughout childhood. We find smaller MVPFs for policies targeting adults, generally between 0.5 and 2. Expenditures on adults have exceeded this MVPF range in particular if they induced large spillovers on children. We relate our estimates to existing theories of optimal government policy, and we discuss how the MVPF provides lessons for the design of future research.},

Using unexploited micro data coming from post electoral, labor, and household surveys,we first revisit commonly accepted unionization levels from the past 60 years. We find that,for France and Italy, union density was at time under- and
over- estimated respectively. Sec-ond, we present long run evidence on the evolution of the composition of unions in terms ofthe socio-economic characteristics (occupation, length of education, public or private
sector,gender) of their members. Two types of unionisation emerge from this analysis. In Franceand Italy, the composition of unions has been primarily determined by structural changesin the composition of the workforce with no notable changes in the selection of the differentgroups into unions when aggregate density varied. In the UK and West Germany, instead,selection into unions has changed dramatically:
Blue collars and less educated worker wereover-represented in the ’60s, but this has declined over time. We argue that these two typesof unionization are related to the institutional characteristics of each country and show thatthe evolution of selection into union is linked to the public-sectorization of unions: as uniondensity fall, the share of public workers in unions increases.},

In the 1950s-1960s, the vote for democratic, labor, social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise to "multi-elite party systems" in the 2000s-2010s: high-education elites now vote for the "left", while high-income elites continue to vote for the "right". This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose key distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorate, respectively. Combining our database with historical data on political parties' programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the educational cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new "sociocultural" axis of political conflict. We also discuss the evolution of other political cleavages related to age, geography, religion, gender, and the integration of new ethnoreligious minorities.},

In a destructive contest, such as war, contest efforts of all groups decrease the value of the prize. In contrast, in a productive contest, such as a patent race, contest efforts of all groups increase the value of the prize. The indirect evolutionary approach allows to endogenize players’ preferences, that is, the utility weights given by a group member, in her subjective utility function, to the material payoffs of in-group and out-group members. After characterizing the set of evolutionarily stable preference types, I show that the evolutionarily stable degree of in-group altruism is always stronger when the group contest is destructive than when it is productive. Moreover, when the group contest is strongly productive, preference evolution leads to in-group spite. However, a smaller group size and a larger number of competing groups makes this outcome less likely.},

	abstract = {In this article, we revisit the main claims of Part Four of Thomas Piketty's Capital and Ideology and especially the changing support coalitions for parties of the left. Piketty's core argument in this part of the book is that the left now represents the highly educated and that, as a result, the redistributive preferences of the working class do not find representation in today's party systems. We address these claims building on existing political science research that has investigated the transformation of politics in advanced capitalist societies. We argue, first, that the educational divide cannot be adequately analyzed by looking at a left and a right bloc, but crucially needs to pay attention to the rise of green/left-libertarian and radical right parties. Second, we contend that the new middle classes that support parties of the left are largely in favor of economic redistribution. Analyzing data from the European Social Survey in 11 West European countries from 2002 to 2018, we show that the effect of education on voting left or right is indeed largely driven by green/left-libertarian and radical right parties, while there is little empirical evidence that social democratic parties represent the educational elite. We also find that redistributive preferences remain at the heart of voting behavior and that, especially for educated voters, these preferences determine whether someone votes for a party of the left rather than the right.},

However, because schedule unpredictability often coincides with low wages and other dimensions of poor job quality, the causal effects of unpredictable work schedules are uncertain. Seattle’s Secure Scheduling ordinance, enacted in 2017, mandated greater schedule predictability, providing an opportunity to examine the causal relationship between work scheduling and worker health and economic security. We draw on pre- and postintervention survey data from workers in Seattle and comparison cities to estimate the impacts of this law using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that the law had positive impacts on workers’ schedule predictability and stability and led to increases in workers’ subjective well-being, sleep quality, and economic security. Using the Seattle law as an instrumental variable, we also estimate causal effects of schedule predictability on well-being outcomes. We show that uncertainty about work time has a substantial effect on workers’ well-being, particularly their sleep quality and economic security.},

Growth regimes are the institutionalized practices central to how a country secures economic prosperity based on complementary sets of firm strategies and government policies. Representation regimes reflect conditions in the arenas of electoral and producer group politics that confer influence on specific segments of the population. The emphasis is on how economic experiences and changes in the structure of electoral cleavages alter the terms of political contestation, thereby giving voice to specific sets of interests and altering the balance of influence between capitalism and democracy. The analysis examines how the growth and representation regimes of the developed democracies have changed through three postwar eras to yield distinctive distributive outcomes in each era.},

	abstract = {First published in 1989, The Undeserving Poor was a critically acclaimed and enormously influential account of America's enduring debate about poverty. Taking stock of the last quarter century, Michael B. Katz's new edition of this classic is virtually a new book. As the first did, it will force all concerned Americans to reconsider the foundations of our policies toward the poor, especially in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2008.Katz highlights how throughout American history, the poor have been regarded as undeserving: people who do not deserve sympathy because they brought their poverty on themselves, either through laziness and immorality, or because they are culturally or mentally deficient. This long-dominant view sees poverty as a personal failure, serving to justify America's mean-spirited treatment of the poor. Katz reminds us, however, that there are other explanations of poverty besides personal failure. Poverty has been written about as a problem of place, of resources, of political economy, of power, and of market failure. Katz looks at each idea in turn, showing how they suggest more effective approaches to our struggle against poverty.The Second Edition includes important new material. It now sheds light on the revival of the idea of culture in poverty research; the rehabilitation of Daniel Patrick Moynihan; the resurgent role of biology in discussions of the causes of poverty, such as in The Bell Curve; and the human rights movement's intensified focus on alleviating world poverty. It emphasizes the successes of the War on Poverty and Great Society, especially at the grassroots level. It is also the first book to chart the rise and fall of the "underclass" as a concept driving public policy.A major revision of a landmark study, The Undeserving Poor helps readers to see poverty-and our efforts to combat it--in a new light.},

Sociological theories of labeling and stigmatization, as well as economic theories of statistical discrimination, suggest a possible causal connection between the two phenomena. Surveys of employers have shown increasing reliance on criminal background checks, for example, and audit studies reveal explicit discrimination against people with felony-level criminal records. This paper draws on novel, state-level annual measures of individuals with felony-level records to estimate pooled cross-sectional, panel models predicting changes in aggregate employment rates. Estimates from these models indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of a state's adult population with a felony history is associated with 0.3 percentage point increase in non-employment (being unemployed or not in the labor force) among those aged 18 to 54. Subgroup analysis shows that effects are stronger for women and whites. These results suggest that the stigma of a felony record may play an important part in aggregate employment rates as well as in individual hiring practices.},

	abstract = {Regression discontinuity (RD) designs are increasingly common in political science. They have many advantages, including a known and observable treatment assignment mechanism. The literature has emphasized the need for “falsification tests” and ways to assess the validity of the design. When implementing RD designs, researchers typically rely on two falsification tests, based on empirically testable implications of the identifying assumptions, to argue the design is credible. These tests, one for continuity in the regression function for a pretreatment covariate, and one for continuity in the density of the forcing variable, use a null of no difference in the parameter of interest at the discontinuity. Common practice can, incorrectly, conflate a failure to reject evidence of a flawed design with evidence that the design is credible. The well-known equivalence testing approach addresses these problems, but how to implement equivalence tests in the RD framework is not straightforward. This paper develops two equivalence tests tailored for RD designs that allow researchers to provide statistical evidence that the design is credible. Simulation studies show the superior performance of equivalence-based tests over tests-of-difference, as used in current practice. The tests are applied to the close elections RD data presented in Eggers et al. (2015b).},

The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.},

To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches—dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning—to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.},

I argue that we can better realize the full potential of machine learning by leveraging the epistemological alignment between machine learning and inductive research. I empirically demonstrate this alignment through a word embedding model of first-person narratives of the nineteenth-century U.S. South. Situating social categories in relation to social institutions via an inductive computational analysis, I find that the cultural and economic spheres discursively distinguished by race in these narratives, the domestic sphere distinguished by gender, and Black men were afforded more discursive authority compared to white women. Even in a corpus over-representing abolitionist sentiment, I find white identities were afforded a status via culture not allowed Black identities.},

	abstract = {This book analyses the historical development of job security regulations in Western Europe from the establishment of freedom of contract in the nineteenth century until the heyday of two-tier labour market reforms in the 2000s. Job security regulations restrict managerial capacity to dismiss employees or use new forms of employment (e.g. temporary work) when hiring new workers. The book makes four main contributions: First, it shows that trade unions are the main driving force behind the extension of job security regulations because these regulations protect the union organization in the workplace and award them an important role in company decision-making. Second, it demonstrates that the extension of dismissal protection was only possible in periods in which the power resources of the labour movement temporarily exceeded those of employers, such as in the immediate aftermath of World Wars 1 and 2 as well as in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a ‘red wave’ swept over Western Europe. Third, it shows that the trade unions’ desire to maintain institutional control caused them to push for the regulation of job security by means of collective agreements. In the medium term, this preference had the paradoxical effect that countries with strong labour movements featured lower levels of statutory dismissal protection than countries with weak and fragmented labour movements. Finally, it demonstrates that the trade unions’ interest in dismissal protection prompted them to assent to two-tier labour market reforms from the 1980s onwards, thereby contributing to the dualization of Western European labour markets.},

A common view holds that surveillance prevents resistance by providing regimes with high-quality intelligence on dissident networks and by instilling fear in citizens. We contrast this view using formerly classified data from Communist Poland. We find that communities exposed to secret police officers were more likely to organize protests but also engaged in less sabotage. To ensure that the relationship is causal, we use an instrumental variable strategy, which exploits the exogenous assignment of Catholic “spy priests” to local communities. To trace the underlying mechanisms, we draw on qualitative interviews and archival sources. We document that Poland’s comprehensive use of surveillance created widespread anger as well as an incentive for citizens to reveal their true loyalties, thus facilitating antiregime collective action. Once on the streets, protesters refrained from sabotage to signal their political motivation to bystanders and authorities alike.},

Because of this, inequality does not just describe how outcomes are distributed. It also serves as a kind of input into people’s thinking and decision making. In this paper, we provide an overview of our recent work examining the ways that inequality can function as a social context that shapes people’s expectations, needs, desires, and attributions. We argue that people’s positions in economic hierarchies can shape perceptions of what people believe to be fair and how much people need. Better understanding these psychological mechanisms may help to explain the associations between inequality and effects at the societal level, such as health outcomes and crime. When it comes to inequality, it may be intuitively appealing to emphasize fair processes over equitable outcomes, and having enough rather than some people having more.

It argues that unions are the main political actors pushing for their expansion of regulations, but given employers’ opposition, unions are able to enforce better protection only in exceptional periods. Once the first restrictions are in place, employers use their power advantages at the workplace level to circumvent regulations, which unions combat by reducing the level of discretion awarded to employers in interpreting regulations. In recent decades, job security regulations have come under increasing pressure. Unions have reacted to this new situation by consenting to the continuous deregulation of temporary employment, while they fight any attempt at deregulating job security in open-ended contracts in order to protect their members’ interests and their institutional involvement in the administration of dismissals. The theoretical argument is supported by empirical evidence from four Western European countries since the postwar period.},

"the government reduced the role of agencies and councils with union participation. Second, the government empowered employers to resist union demands, for instance by enhancing employers' freedom to dismiss workers involved in industrial action. Third, the government regulated unions' decision-making procedures.

This article draws lessons from the reaction of sovereign bond markets to franchise extensions between 1800 and 1920. If franchise extension transferred political power from economic and financial elites to workers, as redistributive theories of democratization suggest, then this should have resulted in a fall in the market price (increase in the yield) of a country’s bonds. Exploiting the asynchronous timing of franchise reforms across countries, we provide evidence that franchise extension contributed to large increases in the premium demanded by investors to hold sovereign debt, reflecting investor fears of default.

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.},

	abstract = {This book analyzes the multi-faceted scandal that has tarnished the reputation of the United Auto Workers (UAW), an iconic union revered for its commitment to union democracy and ethical practices, showing what went wrong to lead the spread of corruption and how to remedy it. 

Masters and Goeddeke provide a historical context of the rise and decline of the UAW, leading to "a culture of corruption" and resulting in the indictment or conviction of 15 union and corporate officials for the misuse of tens of millions of dollars. The book evaluates the various proposed reforms of the UAW's financial practices and ethical standards, including the possibility of a government takeover. It raises questions about the wisdom of such a takeover, based on the problems associated with the government takeover of the Teamsters. The authors recommend that the UAW convene a special constitutional convention to consider reforms in governance and hiring practices. 

Providing a clear depiction of this scandal and the UAW’s systemic flaws, and suggesting potential remedies, this book will appeal to the tens of thousands of union officers and members keenly interested in the state of labor and an iconic union, their corporate counterparts in management, academics, students, and journalists in the fields of business and society, employee relations, law, labor relations, and management.},

"Weitzman (1974) showed that quantity targets may dominate price instruments (such as a subsidy) under such conditions.

"Instead of defining precisely each party's obligations, the agreement establishes broad goals and a regime for evaluating achievement of them" (Rodrik and Sabel 2019:9)

"in conspicuous, recent cases local learning is scarcely an afterthought." (Rodrik and Sabel 2019:21)
"The new project faced a double challenge: On the one hand it had to identify emerging opportunities on the local labor market, alert the city's community college system (then still inattentive to business needs) to them, and help shape the substance and timing of new courses to meet the needs of firms and students. On the other hand it had to learn to support a population of high-risk learners, almost of whom needed to pass difficult remedial courses to qualify for further study, and many of whom had family and financial burdens on top of anxieties about returning to school."

Approximately one-quarter of workers in the United States are employed in poorly paid jobs, earning barely enough to keep body and soul together. The share is far higher than in other developed industrialized countries. International comparisons have shown that such high shares of low-wage work are not an inevitable fate. Many European countries, notably the Scandinavian countries, show that high employment and low unemployment rates can most certainly go hand in hand with a narrow income spread. That narrower income spread must be underpinned by higher investment in education and training, particularly in the bottom quartile of the population. This investment will also make greater social equality economically feasible by raising productivity. A good deal is known today about the reasons for the varying degrees of income inequality in the industrialized countries. The decisive factor in determining the primary income distribution is the level of coverage by collective agreement, and for the secondary income distribution it is the level of redistribution via the taxation system and the welfare state. However, less research has been carried out on the particular reasons for the high concentration of bad jobs in certain industries.
In Creating Good Jobs, edited by Paul Osterman, the focus is indeed on the individual industry. He asks whether inequality can be mitigated by industry-specific strategies or by more general strategies, such as increasing the minimum wage or strengthening collective bargaining and the trade unions. Osterman sees a clear case for industry-based strategies. This approach is because it is only at industry level that win-win situations for improving work organization can be identified; career ladders for promotion can be designed; and the characteristics of a firm’s external environment, which have to be changed in order to create good working and employment conditions, can be properly understood (pp. 6–7). Nonetheless, Osterman is not quite so certain that an industry-based strategy alone would be successful. He writes, “The chapters reveal that there are policies that cut across, and it would be an error not to make note of them” (p. 20). This tension between industry-specific and cross-sectoral strategies runs through the entire book, although no conclusive answer as to the relationship between the two is given.
The empirical relevance of industry-specific strategies is examined in seven case studies by established experts on each of the industries under investigation. These seven industries (retail, residential construction, long-term care, hospitals and outpatient care, restaurants, manufacturing, and trucking) are both representative and sufficiently varied to encompass a suitably broad spectrum of specific industry conditions and strategies. They employ approximately 55\% of all US civilian workers aged 25–64 who are not self-employed, work in for-profit companies, and earn less than \$12 an hour (p. 7).
All seven case studies are similarly structured. They begin by analyzing the working and employment conditions, the skill requirements, the pay and social security, the competitive conditions, and the labor unions’ hitherto unsuccessful attempts to organize workers in each of the industries. On this basis, proposals for improving working and employment conditions are formulated. The case studies have many commonalities. The high share of low-wage work is in every case a consequence of the erosion of protective institutions, in particular the declining value of the minimum wage and the reduction in coverage by collective bargaining.
The many power struggles the unions have lost are described: their ability to act having been massively weakened by the fragmentation of companies through outsourcing, the growing use of lower-paid precarious workers, the well-organized anti-union strategies adopted by employers, and a lack of political support. At the same time, the importance of regulating product markets becomes apparent. If price becomes the decisive competitive factor, working and employment conditions in all industries become differentiated. In those segments offering high-quality products or high-value services to customers with deep pockets, wages are usually somewhat higher than the industry average. Skill requirements in these segments are higher and companies try to reduce labor turnover by offering better terms and conditions. Moreover, virtually all industries also have groups of “good” employers that seek to treat their employees fairly.
One of the cross-cutting questions in all the chapters is whether it is possible for employers to learn by imitating the good examples in their own industries. The answers to this key question vary. Osterman sees in long-term care the crucial starting point in the development of productive ways of working. If this also made it possible to cut costs, then the most important funding bodies, such as Medicaid agencies and managed-care insurance companies, could also be persuaded to introduce similar ways of working (p. 136). All the other authors are more than skeptical about this.
Françoise Carré and Chris Tilly doubt whether the good working and employment conditions in the higher-income consumer segment would still be profitable in the lower-income majority segment (p. 47). They see little prospect of improving working and employment conditions by publicizing examples of employers that create better jobs; for them, the only solution is to create the same competitive conditions at industry level by establishing minimum conditions binding on all employees. A similar argument is advanced by Rosemary Batt, Tashlin Lakhani, Jae Eun Lee, and Can Ouyang in the case of restaurants. Price competition in that sector is so intense, they argue, that enforcement of the existing labor standards is the fundamental precondition for all further strategies.
In contrast to other industries, Susan Helper and Raphael Martins are able in their chapter on manufacturing to draw on many studies that show that high-road business strategies are not a purely philanthropic concern but instead can improve productivity and profitability. They wonder why, despite this clear evidence, the high-road models are not more widely adopted. One important reason, they suggest, is the free rider problem. Since suppliers too would have to be offered technical assistance and training in order to upgrade, competitors would also benefit. Furthermore, the positive effects would make themselves felt only in the medium term (pp. 265–66). Individual companies could not construct the ecosystems that would be required in a tightly networked industry. In their view, the development of apprenticeship systems, for example, and of other supporting institutions is ultimately the responsibility of government. Russell Ormiston, Dale Belman, Julie Brockman, and Matt Hinkel make an argument for a strengthening of high-quality craftsmanship in residential construction through licensing as well as stringent building codes and thorough building inspections (p. 103).
Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt emphasize that advancement to good jobs in hospitals, such as those of nurses, is virtually impossible without further training that is cost- and time-intensive. That is precisely what an individual company cannot afford to do, however, which is why a national system of training and upgrading centers is indispensable (p. 181). Steve Viscelli also sees binding regulations as the only way of achieving sustainable improvements in working and employment conditions in the trucking industry. Above all, all hours worked, including waiting times, would first have to be recorded. The extension of full coverage by the Fair Labor Standards Act would make the truckers eligible for overtime pay (pp. 304–5).
Thus, the message of the industry chapters is, for the most part, very clear. In all the typical low-wage industries, price competition is so intense that sustainable improvements in working and employment conditions can be achieved only by introducing generally binding, industry-wide regulations. Such regulations could act directly on working and employment conditions, for example, by strengthening enforcement of existing labor standards and raising the minimum wage and by introducing collective agreements, statutory schedule regulations, or levy-financed training programs. They could also help to shape product markets, for example, by means of licensing or building codes or promoting innovation throughout entire supply chains. As a European reader, I am surprised that none of the authors proposed equal pay for part-timers and workers in other precarious employment forms. Given the wide pay differentials and American sensitivities around equal treatment, it would have been an obvious proposal.
The book, and in particular its informative and excellently written industry studies with their abundant insights into the often hidden world of poorly paid work, is absolutely worth reading. It is a pity that the industry analyses, including the proposals they contain, have not been systematically evaluated by the editor in order to answer his starting question. So I have to try to provide an answer myself. To cut to the chase, it is that industry-specific regulations must be embedded in a drive to raise and implement general labor standards. It is most certainly not sufficient simply “to make note of them” (p. 20).

We use evidence from a series of stated-preference experiments to estimate workers’ willingness-to-pay for a broad set of job characteristics, which we validate with actual job choices. We find that working conditions vary substantially across workers, play a significant role in job choice decisions, and are central components of the compensation received by workers. Preferences vary by demographic groups and throughout the wage distribution. We find that accounting for differences in preferences for working conditions often exacerbates wage differentials by race, age, and education, and intensifies measures of wage inequality.},

	abstract = {Technology is widely considered the main source of economic progress, but it has also generated cultural anxiety throughout history. The developed world is now suffering from another bout of such angst. Anxieties over technology can take on several forms, and we focus on three of the most prominent concerns. First, there is the concern that technological progress will cause widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment and a further increase in inequality in the short run, even if the long-run effects are beneficial. Second, there has been anxiety over the moral implications of technological process for human welfare, broadly defined. While, during the Industrial Revolution, the worry was about the dehumanizing effects of work, in modern times, perhaps the greater fear is a world where the elimination of work itself is the source of dehumanization. A third concern cuts in the opposite direction, suggesting that the epoch of major technological progress is behind us. Understanding the history of technological anxiety provides perspective on whether this time is truly different. We consider the role of these three anxieties among economists, primarily focusing on the historical period from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and then compare the historical and current manifestations of these three concerns.},

The region studied here is characterized by stark incongruity - the co-existence of massive natural wealth (coal and land) with pervasive human poverty attended by high unemployment, limited education, malnutrition, and the prevalent hazards of mining coal: black lung, dismemberment, death, and ecological ruin. This has been the region's status quo under the decades of domination by a British company and its absentee owners. Despite these departure conditions and frequently violent union struggles, culminating in the 1969 murder of UMW reformist Jock Yablonski, acquiescence to this status quo has been maintained. Gaventa searches out the answers to how and why wealth and poverty continue to coexist and the powerless continue to accede to the powerful. His astute analysis poses broader questions about the politics of poverty, working-class consciousness, and corporate power in America.},

An increasing number of economic studies using survey and experimental methods have shown that nonmonetary incentives and nonpecuniary aspects of one’s job have substantial impacts on job satisfaction, productivity, and labor supply. By drawing on this evidence and relating it to the literature in psychology, this paper argues that work represents much more than simply earning an income: for many people, work is a source of meaning. In the next section, we give an economic interpretation of meaningful work and emphasize how it is affected by the mission of the organization and the extent to which job design fulfills the three psychological needs at the basis of self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We point to the evidence that not everyone cares about having a meaningful job and discuss potential sources of this heterogeneity. We sketch a theoretical framework to start to formalize work as a source of meaning and think about how to incorporate this idea into agency theory and labor supply models. We discuss how workers’ search for meaning may affect the design of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. We conclude by suggesting some insights and open questions for future research.},

Chile was one of the first to establish such a system, which at the time was widely cited as a model for other countries. This article discusses the particular political context in which the Chilean system was created before examining how it works in terms of coverage and levels of benefits received by unemployed workers. The authors undertake a detailed analysis of the administrative data produced by the system and conclude that the insurance covers only a small proportion of the unemployed, as most workers generally had precarious jobs that did not allow them to contribute to the system consistently. The Chilean case illustrates how difficult it is to establish functioning unemployment insurance in developing countries with precarious labour markets. Based on the interaction between employment characteristics and the conditions imposed by the benefit system, the article assesses the efficacy of the Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts (UISA) system and analyses whether it can indeed serve as a model for other developing countries.},

We first examine the historical origin and evolution of social protection systems in developing countries, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the authoritarian roots of developing nations' social policy. As a preliminary effort to remedy this shortcoming in the literature, we offer a political logic for the observed variation in the character of institutions of social policy established by nondemocratic regimes. Next, we explore recent research examining linkages between models of economic development and welfare regimes in developing countries. Finally, we turn to the study of the political determinants of the social policy reforms that occurred in the final decades of the twentieth century, arguing that variation in reform across policy areas has been more complex than is generally appreciated in the literature. To explain this variation, we develop a theory that identifies the political coalitions supporting different policy outcomes.},

I argue formally that more unequally distributed resources across unions should inhibit the centralization of strike powers in union federations. Using membership as a proxy for union resources, I find empirical evidence for this hypothesis in a panel of 15 OECD democracies, 1950–2000.

In the first part, he finds a strong statistical relationship between union density and state employment law enactments. Next, analyzing the cases the model identifies as “deviant” (Pennsylvania and Maine), he uses systematic process tracing to test the hypothesis that labor unions were integral players in legislative campaigns for stronger employment laws. Strong evidence supports the hypothesis that labor unions, even as they declined, contributed to the construction of this new system of subnational work regulation—arguably one of their most significant and durable legacies.},

We discuss their benefits and limitations, and provide guidelines for adoption. Each of the seven procedures finds inspiration in Merton's ethos of science as reflected in the norms of communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism.

Why do the strongest groups in such conflicts ever change their minds about the acceptability of institutional arrangements they once opposed? Drawing on the cases of Ireland in 1986–87 and Italy in 1989–93, this article demonstrates how the process of common knowledge creation between employers and unions changed the course of negotiations over national wage bargaining institutions. Common knowledge creation happens when existing institutions are in crisis. The institutional experimentation that follows such crises, characterized by deep uncertainty, places a premium on persuasive argument. The ideas most likely to serve as the basis for newly common knowledge will have analytical and distributive appeal to both unions and employers, and they must be ratified in public agreements, which I call common knowledge events. Common knowledge events establish new social facts, which can change the payoffs associated with different institutional outcomes. This can lead even powerful actors to accept institutions they had previously opposed.The author thanks Marius Busemeyer, Mary Louise Culpepper, Keith Darden, Orfeo Fioretos, Archon Fung, Peter Hall, Andrew Martin, Cathie Jo Martin, Victoria Murillo, Kathleen Thelen, and Gunnar Trumbull, along with three anonymous reviewers and the editors of IO, for comments and conversations that improved this article.

To examine the expectations the author looks to the puzzle posed by events in Australia and New Zealand, 1983-1996. Facing similar macroeconomic crises and with historically similar wage bargaining institutions and levels of union density both elect Labor governments, which then make opposite choices: A negotiated solution emerged in Australia but not in New Zealand.

Past research finds that union members are more likely to engage in protest, but it is unclear whether unions increase protest among non-members. This study draws on two waves of data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and examines two mechanisms through which labor unions facilitate political protest among non-members: social ties and aggregate strength. We provide evidence that labor unions mobilize non-members to engage in political protest. When non-members have a social tie to a union or live in a state where unions are more robust and widespread, they are more likely to engage in political protest, but no more likely to engage in non-collective forms of political participation such as donating to political causes or contacting officials. The findings extend our understanding of an important, but understudied, act of political behavior as well as the ways that societal institutions stimulate collective political mobilization.},

We use detailed panel data covering a period of decentralization in the Danish labor market. The decentralization process provides variation in the individual worker’s wage-setting system that facilitates identification of the effects of decentralization. We find a wage premium associated with firm-level bargaining relative to sector-level bargaining and that the return to skills is higher under the more decentralized wage-setting systems. Using quantile regression, we also find that wages are more dispersed under firm-level bargaining compared to more centralized wage-setting systems.},

We consider trade unions’ incentives to oppose or endorse labour-saving technology and firms’ incentives to invest in such technology. Increased flexicurity – interpreted as less employment protection and a higher reservation wage for workers – unambiguously increases firms’ incentives for technology adoption. If unions have some direct influence on technology, a higher reservation wage also makes unions more willing to accept technological change. Less employment protection has the opposite effect, as this increases the downside (job losses) of labour-saving technology.},

	abstract = {We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US 
employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which 
enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, 
automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced 
by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because 
of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production—due to automation 
and new tasks—can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is 
accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in 
previous decades.},

Economic activities, including production and employment, occur unevenly across space within countries, and globalization consequently impacts various regions differently.

Economic geography also influences governments’ responses to globalization and economic shocks. Economic geography consequently merits the attention of political scientists. By examining economic geography, researchers will find new traction on long-standing theoretical debates and valuable insights on recent developments, including the growing backlash against globalization.

Today, strident party competition and partisan polarization are blamed for many of the ills of national and state politics. But a much deeper political science tradition points to the virtues of competitive party politics. In this historical analysis, we find that states with competitive party systems spend more than other states—and specifically spend more on education, health, and transportation, areas identified as investments in human capital and infrastructure. We find that this spending leads to longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, better educational outcomes, and higher incomes.

Far more people lose from globalization, and fewer gain, than traditional economic models suggest. We review three modern trade theories (neo-Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson or H-O-S-S, new new trade theory, and economic geography) that each arrive at the conclusion of top-heavy inequality by introducing some form of unit heterogeneity—an assumption that the actors we once treated as identical actually differ from one another in important ways. Heterogeneity allows the gains from globalization to concentrate in a narrow segment of workers with superlative talents, extraordinarily productive firms, or heavily agglomerated cities. An analysis of European voting data shows that shocks from trade and migration elicit populist opposition only where the top 1 percent have gained the most. With few politically feasible alternatives to protectionism, most notably the failure of democracies to redistribute income, our analysis predicts a persistence of public support for antiglobalization parties, especially those on the Right.},

	abstract = {Recent empirical work in several economic fields, particularly environmental and energy economics, has adapted the regression discontinuity (RD) framework to applications where time is the running variable and treatment begins at a particular threshold in time. In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework. First, many applications (particularly in environmental economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using observations far from the temporal threshold. This common empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second, estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing to use the RD in time framework.},

In this paper, we assess a novel explanation for both the initial establishment of a centralized wage-setting process, and its subsequent collapse. According to our theory, centralized wage bargaining was set up as a response to the spillovers created by the unemployment benefit program. Its collapse was the result of the increase in the productivity gap across workers, brought about by equipment-specific technological progress and equipment—skill complementarity.},

We formalize these ideas to provide a more robust and realistic framework for decentralized identity.  We build upon the concepts web-of-trust and social collateral, from cryptography and economics, to provide a system of defining, verifying, and making use of identity through networks.  We exploit the redundancy created by intersectionality together with the fragmentation of identity suggested by self-sovereign schemes to minimize social collateral required for verification. We exploit the probabilistic structure of Bloom filters to provide uniqueness proofs to prevent Sybil attacks while conveying minimal compromising information to verifiers.

Advances in technology now enable new, hybrid methods that combine some of the benefits of both approaches. Drawing inspiration from online information aggregation systems like Wikipedia and from traditional survey research, we propose a new class of research instruments called wiki surveys. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on contributions from participants, we envision an evolving survey driven by contributions from respondents. We develop three general principles that underlie wiki surveys: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. Building on these principles, we develop methods for data collection and data analysis for one type of wiki survey, a pairwise wiki survey. Using two proof-of-concept case studies involving our free and open-source website www.allourideas.org, we show that pairwise wiki surveys can yield insights that would be difficult to obtain with other methods.},

sample surveys. This article is a review of the use of IPW in epidemiological research. We describe how
the bias in the complete-case analysis arises and how IPW can remove it. IPW is compared with multiple
imputation (MI) and we explain why, despite MI generally being more efficient, IPW may sometimes be
preferred. We discuss the choice of missingness model and methods such as weight truncation, weight

One reason is that using the latter can effectively alter the question being addressed by including irrelevant distributional assumptions. The Fisherian statistical framework, proposed in 1925, calculates a P value in a randomized experiment by using the actual randomization procedure that led to the observed data. Here, we illustrate this Fisherian framework in a crossover randomized experiment. First, we consider the first period of the experiment and analyze its data as a completely randomized experiment, ignoring the second period; then, we consider both periods. For each analysis, we focus on 10 outcomes that illustrate important differences between the asymptotic and Fisher tests for the null hypothesis of no ozone effect. For some outcomes, the traditional P value based on the approximating asymptotic Student’s t distribution substantially subceeded the minimum attainable Fisher-exact P value. For the other outcomes, the Fisher-exact null randomization distribution substantially differed from the bell-shaped one assumed by the asymptotic t test. Our conclusions: When researchers choose to report P values in randomized experiments, 1) Fisher-exact P values should be used, especially in studies with small sample sizes, and 2) the shape of the actual null randomization distribution should be examined for the recondite scientific insights it may reveal.},

We test this framework by studying how Mexican immigration to the United States affected white Americans’ attitudes and behaviors toward Black Americans. We combine survey and crime data with a difference-in-differences design and an instrumental variables strategy. Consistent with the theory, Mexican immigration improves whites’ racial attitudes, increases support for pro-Black government policies, and lowers anti-Black hate crimes while simultaneously increasing prejudice against Hispanics. Results generalize beyond Hispanics and Blacks, and a survey experiment provides direct evidence for recategorization.

However, differences remain in how scholars in the two traditions approach empirical problems. The contrast of rational choice's emphasis on institutions as coordination mechanisms that generate or sustain equilibria versus historical institutionalism's emphasis on how institutions emerge from and are embedded in concrete temporal processes serves as the foundation for the second half of the essay, which assesses our progress in understanding institutional formation and change. Drawing on insights from recent historical institutional work on “critical junctures” and on “policy feedbacks,” the article proposes a way of thinking about institutional evolution and path dependency that provides an alternative to equilibrium and other approaches that separate the analysis of institutional stability from that of institutional change.},

	abstract = {The concept of power is central to international relations. Yet disciplinary discussions tend to privilege only one, albeit important, form: an actor controlling another to do what that other would not otherwise do. By showing conceptual favoritism, the discipline not only overlooks the different forms of power in international politics, but also fails to develop sophisticated understandings of how global outcomes are produced and how actors are differentially enabled and constrained to determine their fates. We argue that scholars of international relations should employ multiple conceptions of power and develop a conceptual framework that encourages rigorous attention to power in its different forms. We first begin by producing a taxonomy of power. Power is the production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate. This general concept entails two crucial, analytical dimensions: the kinds of social relations through which power works (in relations of interaction or in social relations of constitution); and the specificity of social relations through which effects are produced (specific/direct or diffuse/indirect). These distinctions generate our taxonomy and four concepts of power: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive. We then illustrate how attention to the multiple forms of power matters for the analysis of global governance and American empire. We conclude by urging scholars to beware of the idea that the multiple concepts are competing, and instead to see connections between them in order to generate more robust understandings of how power works in international politics.},

developed economies for much of the 20th century but has fallen since the 1980s. We review several
of the leading explanations in the literature for the declining labor share. We then point to hitherto
unexplored dimensions of the data and provide suggestive evidence for a new explanation. In particular, we show that the labor share began a steeper descent in 2000. This more recent break in the laborshare trend coincides with the rapid rise of software investment, which has left a larger impact on
service industries (than manufacturing) and on high-skill, cognitive occupations (than middle-skill,
routine occupations).},

We document, however, that the global labor share has significantly declined since the early 1980s, with the decline occurring within the large majority of countries and industries. We show that the decrease in the relative price of investment goods, often attributed to advances in information technology and the computer age, induced firms to shift away from labor and toward capital. The lower price of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed decline in the labor share, even when we allow for other mechanisms influencing factor shares, such as increasing profits, capital-augmenting technology growth, and the changing skill composition of the labor force. We highlight the implications of this explanation for welfare and macroeconomic dynamics.},

"Concerning employment, the second effect dominates so that unemployment benefits raise employment" (Lechthaler and Ring 2021:750)

"a more generous unemployment benefit system makes participation in the labor force more attractive because receipt of unemployment benefits is typically conditional on active search for a new job" (Lechthaler and Ring 2021:751)

"observe their value of home production for the given period, then have to decided whether they want to search for a job and if they do with how much effort they want to search." (Lechthaler and Ring 2021:753)
"The treatments differ in the extent of benefit eligibility" (Lechthaler and Ring 2021:753)
"Two treatments start out with high eligibility (6 periods) and two start out with low eligibility (3 periods). Furthermore, treatments differ in how they react to the recession-period. In one treatment eligibility is reduced from 6 to 3, in one treatment it is increased from 3 to 6 and in the two remaining treatments eligibility stays fixed" (Lechthaler and Ring 2021:753)

We build a macroeconomic model with two pure strategy regimes. In the pure G-regime, workers invest in general skills. This occurs when they face high turnover labor markets and in the absence of employment protection. The pure 5-regime in which workers invest in skills specific to their job appears when employment protection is high enough.

"workers invest more in specific human capital relative to general human capital when the allocation of workers to jobs is less efficient—i.e., a lower-scale parameter of a matching function—and when employment protection is higher." (Wasmer 2006:811)
"the farther away from a competitive environment, defined here as a limit case with instantaneous job matching and no employment protection, the higher are the various incentives to acquire specific skills." (Wasmer 2006:811)
"general skills and higher job turnover generate a coherent, yet different, labor market." (Wasmer 2006:811)
"specific skills and low turnover tend to reinforce each other due to a reverse causality: higher specificity of skills reduces turnover, since specialization improves the worker's current position, while it leaves outside options unchanged by definition." (Wasmer 2006:811)
"The model also suggests that country-differences in the accumulation of specific skills due to differences in labor market institutions may deliver an a priori plausible account of the divergence between continental Europe and the United States" (Wasmer 2006:811)
"Employment protection is seen as a key explanatory factor for the differences between labor markets, reducing not only inflows from employment into unemployment, but also outflows from unemployment into employment." (Wasmer 2006:812)
"investments in human capital are workers' decisions under a set of incentives provided by the firm." (Wasmer 2006:812)
"More generally, investments in specific skills are more risky, which justifies the assumption of a higher return." (Wasmer 2006:812)
"the risk associated with specific skills may require a higher demand by workers for employment protection or, alternatively, for unemployment benefits, in the absence of an insurance market." (Wasmer 2006:812)
"In short, specific skills increase productivity more than general skills do, and thus improve workers' wages and job duration. On the other hand, general skills raise the bargaining point of workers, thus both their wages and future utility derived from unemployment. In other words, the trade-off is between improving the workers' prospects within or outside the firm" (Wasmer 2006:816)
"specific human capital investments have a higher relative return compared to general human capital investments when the job-finding rate is low." (Wasmer 2006:822)
"high employment protection raises the probability that workers will choose specific skills, by two effects: in raising the duration of jobs, it raises the relative return to specific skills; by depressing the labor market, it reduces the relative return to general skills" (Wasmer 2006:822)
"They confirm in an accurate manner the fact that several ingredients of European labor markets, such as unemployment benefits (not discussed here) or employment protection, generate sector-specific skills." (Wasmer 2006:822)},

"We exploit the fact that the UI extensions, during the past two recessions, had different durations in different states during each month, depending on whether each state qualified or not for the various extensions introduced by legislation" (Farooq et al 2020:3)
"examine if, indeed, offering UI benefits for longer periods of time increases wages. Moreover, we examine if the effect comes from workers and firms matching better with each other or from workers moving to higher paying firms." (Farooq et al 2020:4)
"We use the Abowd-KramarsMargolis (AKM) decomposition to estimate firm and worker fixed effects and then rank firms and workers by their percentile of pay and create a rank similarity index that captures how close the ranks of each firm and worker pair are." (Farooq et al 2020:4)
"longer duration of UI benefits due to the introduction of the extensions increases the quality of employer-employee matches (i.e., reduces the difference in rank between the quality of the employer and employee). In particular, an increase in UI duration of 53 weeks, from 26 weeks (the average duration of UI in most states during normal times) to 79 weeks (close to the average UI benefit duration at the end of 2009) increases the similarity in the ranking by 1 percent. We also find this effect is greater for women than men, for minority than white workers, for less educated than more educated workers and for older than younger workers, all of whom are more likely to be credit-constrained. We also find that the increased duration of UI after the extensions increases the part of earnings that is unexplained by all other worker or firm characteristics, even after controlling for the bargaining power of workers as measured by unionization, pointing that this likely captures the match quality between the employer and employee. On the other hand, we do not find evidence that higher UI benefit duration during the Great Recession leads workers to move to higher paying firms." (Farooq et al 2020:4)
"increasing UI benefit duration significantly decreases the mismatch between the educational attainment of workers and the educational requirements in their new jobs after their unemployment spells for women, non-whites, and less educated workers." (Farooq et al 2020:5)
"we find that UI generosity allows workers to search longer and eventually find jobs better suited to their skills. This means that while some workers may move to better firms others may move to worse firms, depending on their individual rankings. Thus, while the "liquidity effect" is welfare enhancing, the fact that it works through improved employee-employer matches may mean that UI is less welfare enhancing than if UI uniformly increased employer quality for all workers." (Farooq et al 2020:5)
"higher UI should increase wages due to liquidity-constrained individuals' ability to search for longer and find better jobs has also been explored empirically by a handful of papers using data from European countr" (Farooq et al 2020:8)
"we use direct measures of similarity between worker and firm fixed effects as well as a direct measure of whether the firm uniformly pays high wages to investigate how UI benefits affect sorting and firm quality" (Farooq et al 2020:9)
"litt le variability in UI durations during expansionary periods, but the variation grows widely during quarters in recessionary periods when the UI extensions were introduced. Second, there is little variation in UI durations during the early 2000s, while the interquartile range in the duration of UI benefits was much wider during the Great Recession" (Farooq et al 2020:14)
"We restrict our analysis to the main job, which we define as the job with the employer at which that worker earns most of her earnings in a quarter. We restrict the sample only to workers who have had at least two different employers over the period 2000-2013" (Farooq et al 2020:17)
"UI extensions decrease the educational mismatch between worker education and the skills required for the job and increase the educational requirements in the new job relative to the previous job." (Farooq et al 2020:29)},

Our research design allows us to explore whether individuals prioritize social categories when selecting a peer and whether the order in which social categories are prioritized is context dependent. Considering both free and costly decisions, two economic contexts are evaluated: donations (dictator game) and investments (risk game). We find that when selecting a partner, gender appears to be the dominant social category across different conditions, with subjects exhibiting sharp preferences for being matched with a female partner. However, the partner's religion gains prominence as a requested social category when issues concerning social-group decision-making become relevant to one's own payoffs.

	abstract = {Research has documented increasing partisan division and extremist positions that are more pronounced among political elites than among voters. Attention has now begun to focus on how polarization might be attenuated. We use a general model of opinion change to see if the self-reinforcing dynamics of influence and homophily may be characterized by tipping points that make reversibility problematic. The model applies to a legislative body or other small, densely connected organization, but does not assume country-specific institutional arrangements that would obscure the identification of fundamental regularities in the phase transitions. Agents in the model have initially random locations in a multidimensional issue space consisting of membership in one of two equal-sized parties and positions on 10 issues. Agents then update their issue positions by moving closer to nearby neighbors and farther from those with whom they disagree, depending on the agents’ tolerance of disagreement and strength of party identification compared to their ideological commitment to the issues. We conducted computational experiments in which we manipulated agents’ tolerance for disagreement and strength of party identification. Importantly, we also introduced exogenous shocks corresponding to events that create a shared interest against a common threat (e.g., a global pandemic). Phase diagrams of political polarization reveal difficult-to-predict transitions that can be irreversible due to asymmetric hysteresis trajectories. We conclude that future empirical research needs to pay much closer attention to the identification of tipping points and the effectiveness of possible countermeasures.},

	abstract = {During the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 175,000 crowdfunding campaigns were established in the US for coronavirus-related needs using the platform GoFundMe. Though charitable crowdfunding has been popular in recent years, the widespread creation of COVID-19 related campaigns points to potential shifts in how the platform is being used, and the volume of needs users have brought to the site during a profound economic, social, and epidemiological crisis. This study offers a systematic examination of the scope and impacts of COVID-19 related crowdfunding in the early months of the pandemic and assesses how existing social and health inequities shaped crowdfunding use and outcomes. Using data collected from all US-based GoFundMe campaigns mentioning COVID or coronavirus, we used descriptive analysis and a series of negative binomial and linear models to assess the contributions of demographic factors and COVID-19 impacts to campaign creation and outcome. We find significant evidence of growing inequalities in outcomes for campaigners. We find that crowdfunding provides substantially higher benefits in wealthier counties with higher levels of education. People from these areas are more likely to initiate campaigns in response to adverse health and economic impacts of COVID-19, and they also receive more funding compared to people living in areas with lower income and education. Modeling also indicates differential outcomes based on the racial and ethnic composition of county population, though without more detail about who is creating and funding campaigns we cannot explain causality. A targeted qualitative analysis of the top earning COVID-19 campaigns offers further evidence of how user privilege and corporate practices contribute to highly unequal outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how a market-oriented digital technology used to respond to large-scale crisis can exacerbate inequalities and further benefit already privileged groups.},

	abstract = {In a campaign for state or local office these days, you’re as likely today to hear accusations that an opponent advanced Obamacare or supported Donald Trump as you are to hear about issues affecting the state or local community. This is because American political behavior has become substantially more nationalized. American voters are far more engaged with and knowledgeable about what’s happening in Washington, DC, than in similar messages whether they are in the South, the Northeast, or the Midwest. Gone are the days when all politics was local. With The Increasingly United States, Daniel J. Hopkins explores this trend and its implications for the American political system. The change is significant in part because it works against a key rationale of America’s federalist system, which was built on the assumption that citizens would be more strongly attached to their states and localities. It also has profound implications for how voters are represented. If voters are well informed about state politics, for example, the governor has an incentive to deliver what voters—or at least a pivotal segment of them—want. But if voters are likely to back the same party in gubernatorial as in presidential elections irrespective of the governor’s actions in office, governors may instead come to see their ambitions as tethered more closely to their status in the national party.},

Discrimination varies depending upon the type of group identity being studied: it is stronger when identity is artificially induced in the laboratory than when the subject pool is divided by ethnicity or nationality, and higher still when participants are split into socially or geographically distinct groups. In gender discrimination experiments, there is significant favouritism towards the opposite gender. There is evidence for both taste-based and statistical discrimination; tastes drive the general pattern of discrimination against out-groups, but statistical beliefs are found to affect discrimination in specific instances. Relative to all other decision-making contexts, discrimination is much stronger when participants are asked to allocate payoffs between passive in-group and out-group members. Students and non-students appear to discriminate equally. We discuss possible interpretations and implications of our findings.},

Then, I address the need to base future work on collective action on a more general theory of human behavior than has been used to model collective action over the last five decades.

	abstract = {In recent years, scholars and policymakers have devoted considerable attention to the potential consequences of employment noncompetition agreements and to whether legislatures ought to reform the laws that govern the enforcement of these controversial contractual provisions. Unfortunately, much of this interest — and the content of proposed reforms — derives from anecdotal tales of burdensome noncompetes among low-wage workers and from scholarship that is either limited to slivers of the population (across all studies, less than 1\%) or relies on strong assumptions about the incidence of noncompetition agreements. Better understanding of the use of noncompetes and effective noncompetition law reform requires a more complete picture of the frequency and distribution of noncompetes at the individual employee level. Accordingly, in 2014, we administered a nationwide survey of individuals in the labor force to ask them about their employment status, history, and future expectations — including their experience with and understanding of noncompetition agreements. In this Article, we describe the methods we used to carry out this survey and refine the data for analysis in hopes of encouraging other researchers to use survey approaches to fill other, similarly important gaps in our knowledge. To illustrate the value of the survey project, we present a surprising empirical finding from our data, one that raises questions about existing scholarship and theories about why employers use noncompetes: We find little evidence that the incidence of noncompetition agreements in a state (after controlling for potentially confounding factors) has any relationship to the level of enforcement of such agreements in that state. In other words, an employee in California (where noncompetes are prohibited) appears to be just as likely to labor under a noncompete as an employee in Florida (where noncompetes are much more likely to be enforced).},

Noncompetes are more likely to be found in high-skill, high-paying jobs, but they are also common in low-skill, low-paying jobs and in states where noncompetes are unenforceable. Only 10 percent of employees negotiate over their noncompetes, and about one-third of employees are presented with noncompetes after having already accepted job offers. Early-notice noncompetes are associated with better employee outcomes, while employees who agree to late-notice noncompetes are comparatively worse off. Regardless of noncompete timing, however, wages are relatively lower where noncompetes are easier to enforce.

Matching-function heterogeneity plausibly generates a negative relationship between the UI unemployment-duration and wage effects, which holds empirically in our sample and across studies, reconciling disparate wage-effect estimates.

"the average UI wage effect of 0.5 percent is due to an attenuation of wage declines between preand post-unemployment jobs" (Nekoei and Weber 2017:529)
"in response to the nine-week benefit extension, the likelihood of experiencing a wage loss that is larger than 40 percent is reduced by 0.5 percent, while the likelihood of achieving a wage increase between 0 and 10 percent is increased by 0.5 percent" (Nekoei and Weber 2017:529)
"considerable part of the positive 0.5 percent UI wage effect at the individual level is due to more favorable employer-employee matches" (Nekoei and Weber 2017:529)
"The UI system is financed by a 6-percent payroll tax with no experience rating. After exhausting the UI benefits, workers can apply for a mean-tested unemployment assistance" (Nekoei and Weber 2017:530)
"The main outcome variables are nonemployment durations and wage changes between the preand post-unemployment jobs." (Nekoei and Weber 2017:532)
"our results document that nine additional weeks of UI benefit eligibility increase reemployment wages. The most important implication of this finding is that it rejects the hypothesis that unemployment is a state of leisure consumption and the unemployed can find a job whenever they desire. In this case, a more generous UI would have no effect on job quality. Our findings thus provide direct evidence for the existence of significant search frictions in the labor market, which motivate the need for insurance." (Nekoei and Weber 2017:538)
"Estimation results presented in Table 4 panel B show that the UI benefit extension from 30 to 39 weeks does not have a statistically significant effect on any measure of job quality." (Nekoei and Weber 2017:555)
"the benefit extension has no statistically or economically of job quality. In particular, ew job (column 1)" (Nekoei and Weber 2017:555)},

	abstract = {Although understanding the role of race, ethnicity, and identity is central to political science, methodological debates persist about whether it is possible to estimate the effect of something immutable. At the heart of the debate is an older theoretical question: Is race best understood under an essentialist or constructivist framework? In contrast to the “immutable characteristics” or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a “bundle of sticks” that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (a) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (b) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element. These designs can reconcile scholarship on race and causation and offer a clear framework for future research.},

Why did it take social scientists two decades to identify this trend and to incorporate it into debates about contemporary income inequality? Drawing on insights from the history and sociology of science, I argue that the social sciences rely on knowledge infrastructures to monitor trends and identify stylized facts. These infrastructures collect, process, and distribute data in ways that channel sustained attention to particular problems while rendering other potential observations out of focus. Like other infrastructures, they have significant inertia: initial design choices become locked in and shape the kinds of data readily available to future researchers. Thus economic knowledge infrastructures constructed in the mid-20th century, while identifying some forms of increasing income inequality, were incapable of tracking top incomes, which created the conditions for missing the rise of the 1\%.},

In this paper we suggest that competitively significant capabilities often rest on managerial practices that in turn rely on relational contracts (i.e., informal agreements sustained by the shadow of the future). We argue that one of the reasons these practices may be difficult to copy is that effective relational contracts must solve the twin problems of credibility and clarity and that although credibility might, in principle, be instantly acquired, clarity may take time to develop and may interact with credibility in complex ways so that relational contracts may often be difficult to build.},

However, the international comparison of the different features and outcomes of industrial democracy has attracted much less attention. The article addresses this gap by developing three tools: a dashboard of indicators, a composite indicator aiming to measure performance, and a typology addressed to better understanding varieties of national industrial relations system. Whilst industrial democracy performance is defined in a normative way, the typology includes also other aspects related to industrial relations institutions, processes and actors. Both normative and non-normative indicators are included in the dashboard. The three tools allow for cross-time analysis and are seen as complementary for the comparative analysis of industrial democracy in Europe.},

	url = {https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691158006/why-people-cooperate},
	abstract = {Cooperation has long been a key topic in social sciences. Research on cooperation in disciplines such as sociology, political science, business management and social psychology has produced empirical data and models based on diverse methodological and theoretical approaches. This gave rise to an enormous body of literature. Also JASSS testified to this. Therefore, any potential reader may wonder whether a new book on cooperation is really necessary and ask if it has anything new to say. In my opinion, this book by Tom R. Tyler does. The author is a psychology professor and Chair of the Psychology Department at New York University, has done a great deal of influential research on the dynamics of authority within groups, procedural justice, legitimacy and managing group behaviour.
Professor Tyler's analysis focuses on the origin of social cooperation, starting from the evidence that cooperation is a key-factor for creating successful groups, organisations and communities. His main thesis here is that the fundamental factor that impels people to cooperate is social motivation, not instrumental motivation (i.e., a schedule of rewards and punishments).

The book is divided into three main sections. Section 1 (Chapters 1 and 2) describes the different forms of cooperative behaviour and provides an exhaustive summary of motivational models. Section 2 (Chapters 3 to 5) discusses empirical findings that show the predominant role played by social motivations in shaping people's cooperative behaviour. The research was conducted through surveys in three different settings where cooperation was required: organisations, communities and societies, i.e., cooperation with managerial, legal and political authorities. Chapter 3 focuses on cooperation between employees in work settings, Chapter 4 examines cooperation with authorities to regulate people's community lives and Chapter 5 deals with political participation, e.g., working with political leaders and voting. In all cases, stress is placed on the decisive influence of social motivation over instrumental motivation as an explanation of cooperation.

Finally, Section 3 (Chapters 6 to 8) discusses the implications of social motivation as the main factor shaping cooperative behaviour in groups. The conclusion is that cooperation increases in any social group if the group is capable of creating a structure which encourages social motivations over instrumental ones.

To sum up, the book is well written, the ideas are presented clearly and the arguments are empirically grounded. Professor Tyler not only captures the reader's attention, but also manages to change his/her mind about the topic. The book is highly recommended to researchers, academics, professionals and even laypeople interested in the topic. JASSS readers will find inspirations and arguments to build more realistic micro-models of social interaction capable of going beyond the limits of rational choice and utility maximization approaches.},

1992), and the group engagement model (Tyler and Blader, 2000). The three models
share a focus on the fundamental psychological concerns that procedural justice addresses, highlighting the perspective that people care about and react to procedural justice because of the relational message conveyed by fair process. Procedural justice conveys a
positive message to justice recipients about their relationship with the entity enacting
justice, whereas procedural injustice conveys a negative message about that relationship.
We review the development of the relational models of procedural justice, explain their
contribution to several critical issues at the heart of procedural justice research, highlight recent developments in the relational model perspective, and identify important avenues for future research.},

Many consider the effects of this shift inevitable. In Disintegrating Democracy at Work, Virginia Doellgast contends that high pay and good working conditions are possible even for marginal service jobs. This outcome, however, depends on strong unions and encompassing collective bargaining institutions, which are necessary to give workers a voice in the decisions that affect the design of their jobs and the distribution of productivity gains.Doellgast's conclusions are based on a comparative study of the changes that occurred in the organization of call center jobs in the United States and Germany following the liberalization of telecommunications markets. Based on survey data and interviews with workers, managers, and union representatives, she found that German managers more often took the "high road" than those in the United States, investing in skills and giving employees more control over their work. Doellgast traces the difference to stronger institutional supports for workplace democracy in Germany. However, these democratic structures were increasingly precarious, as managers in both countries used outsourcing strategies to move jobs to workplaces with lower pay and weaker or no union representation. Doellgast's comparative findings show the importance of policy choices in closing off these escape routes, promoting broad access to good jobs in expanding service industries.},

The results suggest that performance of emotional labor does not have uniformly negative consequences for workers, as some accounts imply. Instead, the effects of emotional labor are conditioned by workers' level of job autonomy and job involvement, and their self-monitoring abilities. The conditions under which emotional labor has negative and positive social-psychological consequences are discussed.},

The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coeﬃcient and the eﬀect that the coeﬃcient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the cases presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement more extended and formal discussions of the problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

We leverage novel and rich administrative and survey data on travel volumes, modes, and preferences for different demographic groups. Large average declines in travel and public transit use due to the pandemic and related policy responses mask substantial heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups. Travel declined considerably less among less-educated and lower-income individuals, even after accounting for mode substitution and variation across neighborhoods in the impacts of public transit service reductions. As policy became less restrictive and travel increased, the size of the socioeconomic gap in travel behavior remained stable, and remote work capabilities became increasingly important in explaining this gap. Our results imply that disparities in travel behavior across socioeconomic groups may become an enduring feature of the urban landscape.},

"In the 1990s and at the turn of the twenty-irst century, the Chinese model of export-driven growth relied almost exclusively on laborintensive products—apparel, footwear, and other consumer goods that China could produce more cheaply than other countries owing to its low labor costs, its proximity to suppliers in East Asia, and a willingness to let private companies make exacting demands on workers."

"entral burden of such a theory is the demonstration of three linkages: (1) that there existed a strong and important connection between the radical labor upsurge and the broader social movements; (2) that a growing political conflict was taking place within the labor movement, whose balance of power was beginning to shift from conservative leaders and organizations to more radical groupings; and (3) that both these phenomena had a central impact on the labor reform process."

Promarket liberals are generally hostile to the idea of workplace democracy and tend to favour top-down hierarchies as a way of organising labour. This hostility is generally inspired by the neoclassical analysis of exploitation and efficiency, which leads them to defend distributions achieved through exit-based competitive equilibria. Following Hirschman, I propose to consider a hypothetical alternative: a democratic equilibrium, reached through the use of voice. I show that it would present the same appealing characteristics than its competitive counterpart while also accounting for the non-ideal conditions in which markets operate. Support for free markets should entail support for workplace democracy minimally understood as a strengthening of voice.},

For both time frames we propose a two-step sequence: ﬁrst a second-personal morality in which individuals are sympathetic or fair to particular others, and second an agent-neutral morality in which individuals follow and enforce group-wide social norms. Human morality arose evolutionarily as a set of skills and motives for cooperating with others, and the ontogeny of these skills and motives unfolds in part naturally and in part as a result of sociocultural contexts and interactions.},

(Tyler 2019:5)"It suggests that people can and will consent to appropriately enacted and exercised legal and political authority."

(Gordon and Huber 2019:329)"material incentives alone are inadequate to facilitate social cooperation. At the heart of the legitimacy hypothesis is the idea that citizens may voluntarily comply for reasons over and above the likelihood of reward or punishment, but which are tied instead to the characteristics or behavior of authorities and institutions" (Gordon and Huber 2019:330)"the close association of legitimacy with the justifiability of an authority's actions and the question of whether citizens, as moral agents, have an obligation to comply with authority." (Gordon and Huber 2019:330)"obligation implies a motivation to comply apart from extrinsic, material motivations; while justification implicates citizens' beliefs about authorities and institutions." (Gordon and Huber 2019:330)"Understanding the structure of legitimacy in terms of motivations and beliefs allows us, as positive analysts, to draw on gametheoretic intuitions and equilibrium logic." (Gordon and Huber 2019:330)"we can think of legitimacy as a feature of an equilibrium in which citizens' intrinsic motivations are enhanced by those beliefs about authorities, and the actions of governing institutions and their incumbents are consistent with those beliefs" (Gordon and Huber 2019:330)"the term "legitimacy" as defined in the literature tends to conflate a number of analytically distinct factors affecting attitudes about, and cooperation and/or compliance with, authorities and institutions." (Gordon and Huber 2019:331)"legitimacy is often studied in institutional environments where its behavioral consequences are likely to be obscured." (Gordon and Huber 2019:331)"studies of legitimate authority are, with a few exceptions, insufficiently attentive to issues of causal inference and identification." (Gordon and Huber 2019:331)"Insofar as the coercive component of authority may conflict with the autonomy of the individual citizen— itself a primary good— the state must have a compelling rationale to exercise this authority." (Gordon and Huber 2019:332)"From the perspective of liberal political theory, however, justification entails an alignment of government's exercise of power with commonly (or universally) accepted principles." (Gordon and Huber 2019:332)"The linkages among legitimacy, obligation, and consent suggest a behavioral consequence to more legitimate authority, because greater legitimacy will translate into consent and (at least weakly) a greater tendency to obey or cooperate with an authority." (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)""convention consent" and "endorsement consent."" (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)"Consent can therefore vary in degree with legitimacy, and all consent is not evidence of legitimacy." (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)"normative theorists are articulating a notion of motivation to comply distinct from extrinsic motivations." (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)"When we speak of obligation, then, we are speaking of intrinsic motivations to cooperate with or support an authority." (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)"empirical researchers need to isolate intrinsic motivations for behavior in order to instantiate the concept of legitimacy as articulated by normative theorists." (Gordon and Huber 2019:333)"perceptions of fairness (among other values) enhance or diminish the intrinsic motivation to comply." (Gordon and Huber 2019:334)"The beliefs associated with justification, and the actions associated with obligation, must be mutually consistent." (Gordon and Huber 2019:334)"Rather than speak of a general obligation to comply with an authority (or absolute autonomy from such an obligation), we will speak instead of legitimation "on the margin": conditions in which the enhanced intrinsic motivations associated with a legitimate authority incrementally affect the likelihood of compliance, other things being equal." (Gordon and Huber 2019:334)"Crosscountry studies have found that higher levels of income inequality are associated with reduced trust and lower evaluations of government performance;" (Gordon and Huber 2019:337)"Grossman and Baldassari randomly assign an "authority" who has the ability to punish participants in a public goods game to be either selected at random or by voting from among participants. They find that the elected authority is associated with more frequent contributions and interpret this effect as arising due to legitimacy after showing that elected and appointed authorities do not behave differently." (Gordon and Huber 2019:338)"behavioral implications of an absence of legitimacy perceptions may, in many cases, be either unclear or miniscule." (Gordon and Huber 2019:340)"norms and trust can arise through patterns of equilibrium selection in repeat play. For example, individuals may coordinate on a set of behaviors and beliefs that produce desirable outcomes and involve widespread compliance and regime support. In and of itself, this provides no evidence of a belief in the regime's legitimacy." (Gordon and Huber 2019:341)"(which can be described by cutpoints in w), three insights emerge. First, citizens' choices are strategic complements: that is, the more likely citizen i is to contribute, the higher the expected sanction to j from not contributing, and thus, the stronger the incentive of j to contribute. Interestingly, complementarity is enhanced by an aspect of the authority's weakness: the extent to which widespread noncompliance taxes their ability to maintain order. An increase in the state's ability to reliably punish all detected noncompliers reduces the extent of the complementarity.52" (Gordon and Huber 2019:343)"Even if i does not perceive the authority as legitimate at all, the legitimacy of the authority from j's perspective still enhances i's compliance for purely extrinsic reasons. More generally, the authority's legitimacy in the eyes of either citizen may dramatically reduce the range of parameter values supporting the "bad" equilibrium." (Gordon and Huber 2019:344)"These effects are roughly equivalent to what Levi terms "quasivoluntary compliance." (Gordon and Huber 2019:344)"The issue of strategic complementarity implies a violation of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that underlies estimation of average treatment effects." (Gordon and Huber 2019:344)"when authority capacity is limited, strategic complementarities mean that variation in the legitimacy and other motivations for compliance of one citizen affect the incentives of other citizens to comply. These complementarities make isolating which actors' perceptions of legitimacy affect their (versus others') behavior difficult. As such, situations in which such complementarities are minimized will make it easier to isolate the psychological mechanism underlying legitimate authority." (Gordon and Huber 2019:345)"we consider what might occur in situations where an authority can take some (possibly costly) action to enhance the quality of a governing institution." (Gordon and Huber 2019:345)"we proceed from the premise that the perceived fairness of the institution plays a role in enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of citizens." (Gordon and Huber 2019:346)"Leventhal, who draws a useful distinction between distributive and procedural fairness, and focus for the moment on the latter, as it highlights the identification issues most clearly." (Gordon and Huber 2019:346)"critical aspect of procedural fairness is accuracy: the extent to which an institution accurately assigns sanction to noncompliers while exculpating compliers." (Gordon and Huber 2019:346)"To estimate the legitimating effects of institutions, it is advisable to consider institutions that have minimal effects on the material incentives of individuals to comply." (Gordon and Huber 2019:348)"The causal effect of the authority's effort choice propagates through three distinct channels. The first is the personal legitimacy channel:" (Gordon and Huber 2019:348)"authority's effort affects the character of the institution, which in turn affects the extrinsic motivations of the citizen" (Gordon and Huber 2019:348)"one cannot simply regress the citizen's behavior on the authority's action and claim to isolate a legitimacy effect" (Gordon and Huber 2019:348)"identification requires severing the deterministic linkage between the" (Gordon and Huber 2019:348)"authority's choice and the institution" (Gordon and Huber 2019:349)"if effort is known to be randomly or quasirandomly assigned, the citizen should draw no inferences about the authority's type from the observed level of effort, just the same way that a coerced confession is uninformative with respect to actual guilt or innocence." (Gordon and Huber 2019:349)"accuracy is completely randomized, however, then the separating equilibrium will collapse: Higher types will gain nothing from their effort, and all types will choose no effort." (Gordon and Huber 2019:349)"Dickson, Gordon, and Huber describe sufficient conditions for identifying personal legitimacy effects given these issues.57 Essentially, what is required is that the authority's level of effort induces overlapping lotteries over levels of accuracy that are orderable by stochastic dominance." (Gordon and Huber 2019:349)"If the authority takes a costly action, with 50 percent probability the accuracy is "high" and with 50 percent probability it is medium; if the authority foregoes the costly action, with 50 percent probability the accuracy is "medium" and with 50 percent probability it is low." (Gordon and Huber 2019:349)"identifying a causal relationship between the action of an authority and response of a citizen that can accurately be described as "legitimacy" or "legitimation" is difficult owing to the relationship between the authority's legitimating action and the institutional environment of the subject, which activates extrinsic motivations as well as institutional legitimacy considerations." (Gordon and Huber 2019:350)"one wants to provide behavioral evidence about legitimacy, one of two conditions should hold. First, one should look for situations in which, either as a product of researcher intervention or experimental design, individuals are close to indifferent with regard to compliance." (Gordon and Huber 2019:352)"one should focus study on those who are otherwise likely to be close to indifferent with regard to compliance, even if this is only a subset of the larger population affected by a regime" (Gordon and Huber 2019:352)"instances in which, unlike in the cases described above, institutions, policies, and choices that potentially enhance legitimacy diminish material compliance motivations." (Gordon and Huber 2019:352)"Legitimacy should be understood as affecting the intrinsic motivations of citizens to comply because they care about the values an institution or authority embraces or instantiates." (Gordon and Huber 2019:354)"In equilibrium, legitimacy obtains when citizens hold beliefs about an authority that enhance these intrinsic motivations to comply, and authorities take (justifiable) actions that are consistent with those beliefs. Legitimacy therefore has to be understood in terms of the interaction between what authorities and citizens do." (Gordon and Huber 2019:354)"We close with two observations. First, as academic researchers, we believe one of our key roles is to isolate theoretical mechanisms" (Gordon and Huber 2019:356)},

The question is: consequences for what ends, goals, or values? Simplifying my discussion somewhat. I was concerned with three general types of consequences: consequences for economic effectiveness, for property rights, and for rights to a democratic process.As to property rights, though I expressed skepticism about applying the standard moral argument for property rights to business firms, my preferred solution, as Professor Mayer points out, does not entail a violation of basic rights to property, or, for that matter, existing property rights in business firms. It could simply“entail a shift ownership from stockholders to employees”(p. 113).As to economic effectiveness, I argued that employee-owned firms could be as effective in achieving such intermediate goods as investment, growth, and employment (p.120ff.). I argued further that they could be as efficient as American corporations at present in minimizing“the ratio of valued inputs to valued outputs”both in the narrow sense ordinarily employed by economists, for whom the outputs are those valued by consumers, and in a broader sense that would include outputs“we as producers value”(p. 130).},

We examine the political implications of this immense structural shift by introducing the concept of status discordance, which we operationalize as the difference between status expectations formed during childhood and outcomes realized in adulthood. We leverage German household panel data and predictive modeling to provide empirical estimates of status expectations based on childhood circumstances and parental background. The analysis reveals that political dissatisfaction is widespread among voters who fall short of intergenerational status expectations. We show that such dissatisfaction is associated with higher abstention rates, less mainstream party support, and more radical voting. Moreover, we explore variation in status discordance by gender, education, and occupation, which influence the choice between radical left and right parties. Our findings highlight how expectations about opportunities underlie generational voting patterns and shed light on the ongoing breakdown of the postwar political consensus.},

Although traditional conceptualizations of punishment divide it into utilitarianism (e.g., deterrence) and retributivism (“eye for an eye”), we argue that a more useful metric of lay attitudes concerns orientation toward or away from punishment. After pilot testing and factor analysis, we used item response theory to assess four scales: prohibitive utilitarianism (limiting punishment based on utility), prohibitive retributivism (aversion to punishing innocent people), permissive utilitarianism (willingness to give strict punishment based on the benefits thereof), and permissive retributivism (desire for just deserts). The POQ showed good predictive validity for capital jury eligibility and sentencing recommendation in response to a death penalty trial stimulus. This study provides a better understanding of how classic punishment philosophies manifest among laypersons and contributes data outside of classical test theory.},

I show that pacts can emerge as part of equilibrium behavior in a repeated game but only if the policymaker is sufficiently willing to work with unions. There is no reason for a pact to exist in the absence of electoral incentives. I hypothesize that pacts are more likely to be struck nearer to elections and with greater Left participation in government. Using an original dataset on social pacts in the OECD, 1974–2000, I find evidence that the onset of pacts is related to elections, partisanship, and EMU convergence pressures.},

Here we study socioeconomic determinants of mobility disruption during both the lockdown and the recovery phases in Italy. For this purpose, we analyze a massive data set on Italian mobility from February to October 2020 and we combine it with detailed data on pre-existing local socioeconomic features of Italian administrative units. Using a set of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, we reliably show that the least and the most affected areas persistently belong to two different clusters. Notably, the former cluster features significantly higher income per capita and lower income inequality than the latter. This distinction persists once the lockdown is lifted. The least affected areas display a swift (V-shaped) recovery in mobility patterns, while poorer, most affected areas experience a much slower (U-shaped) recovery: as of October 2020, their mobility was still significantly lower than pre-lockdown levels. These results are then detailed and confirmed with a quantile regression analysis. Our findings show that economic segregation has, thus, strengthened during the pandemic.},

We use a model of multilateral bargaining to demonstrate that this intuition may be ﬂawed. Increasing the number of veto players or raising the supermajority requirement for redistribution may reduce protection on the equilibrium path. The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their inﬂuence to prevent redistributions. In a stable allocation, the society exhibits a “class” structure with class members having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from redistribution.},

	abstract = {Altruism is a vital source of cooperation and maintenance of social order in human societies. In recent years some evolutionary models of human altruism have predicted that parochialism (favouritism towards members of one's own ethnic, racial or language group) is an important feature of human altruism, but there is little empirical or experimental evidence on the matter. Punishment experiments with indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea now demonstrate that altruistic norm compliance and norm enforcement are strongly influenced by favouritism within ethnic, racial or language groups. In many modern societies there are strong political forces drawing on altruistic sentiments towards 'insiders' and aggressive sentiments towards outsiders. This work challenges existing evolutionary theories by implying a deep-seated basis for such behaviour.},

“We found that punishers protect ingroup victims—who suffer from a norm violation—much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator’s group affiliation.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“Norm violators also expect that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“parochial social instincts15,25—which we define as preferences for favouring the members of one’s own social group—may have shaped human altruism in decisive ways.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“Normative obligations are thus likely to apply only to ingroup members; people who do not belong to the group neither obey the norm nor benefit from the altruistic behaviours the norm enforces.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“The use of cohesive, indigenous groups from simple societies distinguishes our study from minimal group experiments” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“However, the ingroup favouritism observed in these experiments26,27 does not reveal parochial tendencies in human altruism because the subjects only distributed resources between two other subjects” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“costless ingroup favouritism in these experiments is due to the expectation that ingroup members will receive some reciprocation from other ingroup members.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“anonymous, one-shot, third-party punishment experiment16 involving a dictator (player A), a recipient (player B) and a third party (player C). Player A receives an endowment of 10 Kina (K), which is equivalent to a high daily labourer’s wage in the informal sector of the economy. Player B, the recipient, has no endowment and player C, the third party, receives K5. First, A can transfer any amount between K0 and K10 to B. Then C is informed about A’s transfer and has the opportunity to punish A’s action by spending K0, K1 or K2 on punishment. Every Kina spent on punishment reduces A’s income by K3. After player A and C had chosen their actions, we also elicited their expectations about how the dictators would be punished at the three transfer levels K0, K5 and K10.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“designed to capture the altruistic enforcement of egalitarian sharing norms” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“four treatment conditions. (1) All three players in the game are from the same tribe (treatment ABC). (2) Only players B and C are from the same tribe, while A is an outgroup member (BC). (3) Only players A and B are from the same tribe (AB). (4) Only players A and C are from the same tribe (AC). The decisionmakers in all four treatments were informed about the other two players’ group affiliation.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 912)“Thus, the ABC treatment is the only condition in which evolution should have favoured altruistic punishment, because punishment in ABC sustains group norms that enhance a group’s ability to compete with other groups.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 913)“even in the conditions with relatively low punishment levels (AB and AC), 58\% of the third parties punish if the dictator transfers nothing, but only 3\% punish at K5 and nobody punishes at transfers higher than K6. T” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 913)“These findings imply that regardless of the dictator’s group affiliation, punishment is much higher if the recipient and the third party belong to the same group.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 913)“transfers are higher in those conditions where A and B belong to the same group” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 913)“Player A’s reluctance to share if B does not belong to his group is strongly reinforced if the third party comes from A’s group.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 914)“First, these models focus on norm enforcement within groups for the purpose of winning inter-group conflicts while neglecting the potential benefits from cooperative inter-group interactions. This approach makes it difficult to understand when hostility characterizes inter-group reactions and when cooperative norms govern them.” (Bernhard et al., 2006, p. 914)},

We hypothesize that egalitarian distribution norms and cooperation norms apply in our experiments, and that third parties, whose economic payoff is unaffected by the norm violation, may be willing to enforce these norms although the enforcement is costly for them. Almost two-thirds of the third parties indeed punished the violation of the distribution norm and their punishment increased the more the norm was violated. Likewise, up to roughly 60\% of the third parties punished violations of the cooperation norm. Thus, our results show that the notion of strong reciprocity extends to the sanctioning behavior of “unaffected” third parties. In addition, these experiments suggest that third-party punishment games are powerful tools for studying the characteristics and the content of social norms. Further experiments indicate that second parties, whose economic payoff is reduced by the norm violation, punish the violation much more strongly than do third parties.},

The proposed Bayesian synthetic control methods (BSCMs) do not impose any restrictive constraints on the parameter space a priori. Moreover, they provide statistical inference in a straightforward manner as well as a natural mechanism to deal with the “large p, small n” and sparsity problems through Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Using simulations, the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an increase of 5.7\% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5\%∼5.8\% in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121\%.},

	abstract = {The quantification of modern slavery has received increased attention recently as organizations have come together to produce global estimates, where multiple systems estimation (MSE) is often used to this end. Echoing a long-standing controversy, disagreements have re-surfaced regarding the underlying MSE assumptions, the robustness of MSE methodology and the accuracy of MSE estimates in this application. Our goal was to help address and move past these controversies. To do so, we review MSE, its assumptions, and commonly used models for modern slavery applications. We introduce all of the publicly available modern slavery datasets in the literature, providing a reproducible analysis and highlighting current issues. Specifically, we utilize an internal consistency approach that constructs subsets of data for which ground truth is available, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy of MSE estimators. Next, we propose a characterization of the large sample bias of estimators as a function of misspecified assumptions. Then, we propose an alternative to traditional (e.g. bootstrap-based) assessments of reliability, which allows us to visualize trajectories of MSE estimates to illustrate the robustness of estimates. Finally, our complementary analyses are used to provide guidance regarding the application and reliability of MSE methodology.},

This problem is due to the non-identifiability of the latent class model which results in a multimodal posterior distribution.” (Binette and Steorts, p. 17)“This explains our default choice of 200 independent chains in our analyses. Other more sophisticated approaches can be used to deal with peaked and multimodal posteriors which mix poorly, such as parallel tempering (Earl \& Deem, 2005), using parallel chains (Gelman \& Rubin, 1992), and more (Yao et al., 2020). Implementing these approaches would be necessary for the application of LCMCR to larger datasets.” (Binette and Steorts, p. 17)},

We argue that this rise in private debt has become a significant driver of inequality because access to, and the terms of, credit vary by the risk of default, which is closely tied to income. The effect is magnified by a trove of new data that allow lenders to more accurately assess individual risks, thereby linking interest rates more closely to the underlying risk distribution. This inequalizing logic is conditioned by social transfers and by government regulation of financial markets. We test our model with data on mortgage interest rates and access to credit, using the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (FM/FM) in the United States (resulting in regulatory change) and the Hartz-IV reform in Germany (resulting in changes to social transfers) as exogenous changes in important parameters of our model.},

It questions the assumption of a single function made in formal models of social influence and proposes instead that the function will vary depending on which social influence process predominates. It is argued that normative influence is likely to be stronger when participants make public responses and are face-to-face with the majority, whereas informational influence is likely to be stronger when participants make private responses and communicate with the majority indirectly. The meta-analysis finds that the relationship differs according to whether public or private responses are obtained and whether an Asch or Crutchfield paradigm is employed.

	abstract = {Can elections change people’s ideas about what is ethically right and what is wrong? A number of recent observations suggest that social norms can change rapidly as a result of election outcomes. We explore this conjecture using a controlled online experiment. In our experiment, participants rate the social appropriateness of sharing income with poorer individuals. We compare the ratings for situations in which a rule has been elected that asks people to share with ratings when the elected rule asks people not to share. We also compare both situations with ratings in a decision environment in which there is no official rule at all. In the absence of an elected rule, sharing is widely considered socially appropriate, while not sharing is considered socially inappropriate. We show that elections can change this social norm: They shift the modal appropriateness perception of actions and, depending on the elected rule, increase their dispersion, i.e. erode previously existing consensus. As a result, actions previously judged socially inappropriate (not sharing) can become socially appropriate. This power prevails, albeit in a weakened form, even if the election process is flawed (introducing a voting fee or “poll tax”, bribing voters, disenfranchising poorer voters). An additional treatment suggests that both the social information contained in election results and the social appropriateness of following rules per se play a role in shifting social norms.},

 Jeff Wiltse surveys the history of an all-American pastime and the cultural and societal impacts that swimming pools have had on the United States. Wiltse, a history professor at the University of Montana, shows readers how the atmosphere of municipal swimming pools, from their inception, have reflected class divisions and heated racial tensions. Contested Waters takes readers through the complicated transformation of municipal pools from gender segregated public baths of the nineteenth century to the racially segregated and violent municipal pools of the 1950s, and finally ending with the current state of private and municipal pools. Wiltse effectively, and often captivatingly, informs readers of just how much social history is in our swimming pools. Wiltse begins with a detailed look at life before municipal pools and how city officials recognized the need for them. Working class men, boys, and “street urchins” of the northern U.S. swam naked in the natural waters available to them, joking, fighting, and frolicking. Anti-swimming laws and waterside police officers failed to control the ruckus. City officials sought to alleviate the problem by building municipal pools. Located in the slums, the pools provided residents a place to clean themselves, and instill some of the moral beliefs and values that were, according to the middle class, sorely needed. In 1884, Philadelphia opened one of the first municipal pools, but the strict rules enforced by the middle class did little to hinder the rambunctious culture of the working class. Wiltse showed that similar battles for respectability were fought in other American cities, including New York City, Milwaukee, and Boston. According to Wiltse, swimming pools in the late nineteenth century were divided along two lines. Middle-class America saw swimming with the urban poor working class distasteful. In any case, the disease-trodden slums in inner cities of the north kept interactions between the two classes at a minimum. River baths and pools were opened to help tackle the physical squalor of the urban poor. Wiltse observed that racial tensions were muted in comparison to the hostel class conflict that plagued pools in the 1900s. A second division pertained to gender. Even with the modest “bathing suits” covering most of a female’s body, it was \{\vphantom{\}}£ÈÊÊU BOOK REVIEW deemed inappropriate for males and females to swim together. Gender integration at public swimming pools would begin in 1913, with the opening of Fairgrounds Park Pool in St. Louis. Wiltse noted the social class divisions of the Progressive Era continued to heavily influence municipal pools. However, a major change occurred when swimming became socially acceptable to middle-class Americans. Physical exercise was recognized as a healthy pastime and with the opening of Douglas Park Pool and Gymnasium in Chicago in 1895, the first public swimming pools in America to be used for sport and recreation were built. Simultaneously, the era saw swimming becoming increasingly acceptable among women. They would frequent beach baths and beachside resorts that were popular among the upper middle class. With nearly two thousand municipal pools built between 1920 and 1940, the “Swimming Pool Age” hit America with force. Wiltse uses the Fairgrounds Park Pool in St. Louis to illustrate the growing popularity of municipal pools. Fairgrounds Park Pool was built in the style of beachside resorts, with room to lounge on sandy poolside beaches and enough swimming space for thousands at one time. Pools like this popped up across the United States. For the first time, males and females could swim together freely, and pools became a social center of leisure and play for youth as well as adults. Strict social class divisions began to ebb, and a sense of community was gained at the Fairground Park Pool. This sparked the development of hundreds of gender-integrated pools in the 1920s. Suddenly, America’s youths were able to flirt and interact with the opposite sex in an appropriate and exciting setting. The ever-shrinking swimming suits sparked “bathing beauty contests,” allowing viewers to appreciate the figures of young girls in tight suits. Thousands came to bask in the sun with family and friends, creating stronger family ties. These changes, however, kindled flagrant and often bloody discrimination against African Americans at municipal swimming pools, particularly in Northern cities. Wiltse cites three reasons as contributing factors to acute discrimination against Blacks. The first was the Great Black Migration. One and a half million southern Blacks migrated to the north, creating throngs of “Black belt” residences. The 1919 Chicago Riot characterizes the tension between Whites and Blacks. The riot entailed seven days of violence and started when African American teenagers visited a White beach. Enraged Whites abused Blacks physically and verbally when they attempted to use a public swimming beach. The second factor was race-based sanitation. According to Wiltse, Whites believed Black swimmers were diseased and swimming with them would put them at risk. Race-based sanitation was exemplified by the Highland Park Pool in Pittsburgh, where pool employees demanded a “health certificate” from would-be Black swimmers before they were allowed admittance. This pattern was repeated repeatedly throughout the “Swimming Pool Age.” At the heart of the conflict was the third factor, gender-integrated swimming. Fairground Park Pool was the first racially segregated pool, which Wiltse believed was built as a consequence of gender integration. It was believed by Whites that Black men lusted after White women and would take advantage of them if given the opportunity. City officials deemed it unsafe to allow African American men to swim in close quarters to White women. Wiltse also noted that BOOK REVIEW UÊÊ\{\vphantom{\}}£Ç White men did not want Black laborers with muscular physiques to undermine their supposed “superior” masculinity—this could open the door for tabooed interracial relationships with White women. Riots ensued as African Americans made headway in the fight for civil rights. Municipal swimming pools were literally a battleground as Blacks’ struggled for equal access to public amenities. White policemen frequently encouraged Whites' use of violence directed at African Americans swimmers. While some officials attempted to stop desegregation by locating Blacks-only pools in the “Black belts” of northern cities, it did little to deter the wildfire that was the civil right movement. Lawsuits filed over unequal access to municipal and community pools by Black Americans would eventually make equality a reality. In the 1950s, White Americans realized they could no longer control Blacks’ access to the municipal swimming pools they frequented. According to Wiltse, this resulted in a huge increase in the building of private pools. Residential pools, once an unattainable luxury, became a material example of middle-class success in the booming postwar economy. Significantly, private pools allowed White Americans greater control over the people with whom they swam. Private swim clubs and residential pools also signaled the erosion of community support and funding for municipal pools. Many municipal pools became increasingly dilapidated and infected with crime and drugs. Wiltse concludes with a summary of the problems that plagued America and its municipal pools. Swimming pools had the potential to contribute to the “vibrant community life” that was present in the 1920s. But the need for social segregation won out. By removing themselves from municipal swimming pools, White Americans protected their women from Black males, and insulated themselves from those felt to be “undesirable.” Consequently, crumbling municipal pools became a symbol of strained race relations, leaving the working-class Whites and minorities with second-hand recreation spaces that are forever in danger of closing. Contested Waters emphasizes major themes of not only municipal pools, but American culture as well. Wiltse dedicated research took him all over the northern part of the United States, rifling through decades of history in America’s courthouses. His social history shows readers an ugly side of the United States. The accompanying photographs of White swimmers abusing Black swimmers help visualize the horrors of African Americans’ struggle for civil rights. Contested Waters also highlighted the changing views of liberated women in America, from modest bathing suits to the objectified bathing beauties in tight swimming suits. He speculated that sexuality was at the heart of social segregation and provided compelling evidence to support his claims. His evidence lay in the testimonies of both Blacks and Whites, during happy and tense times. One comes from Joseph Plechavy, who “reminisced to me about his childhood days at the town’s swimming pool, where this son of an immigrant laborer ‘yakked’ and played with children who lived on the other side of town. ‘It didn’t matter who you were,’ Plechavy recalled, ‘you swam at the pool’” (p. 208). Anecdotes likes this showed how people felt connected to their community swimming pools. Wiltse also wrote about a White man in a violent mob of St. Louis in 1949 told youths to “Get bricks and smash their heads,” (pg. 171). Direct quotes such as these allow readers to be caught up \{\vphantom{\}}£nÊÊU BOOK REVIEW in the ease of community life at some municipal pools and then understand the magnitude of the racial tensions at others. Another strength of Contested Waters is its clear documentation of central theme of social segregation of class, gender, and race. Wiltse spoke of women bathing on separate days in the late 1800s and early 1900s, of the urban poor being a problem for the middle and upper classes throughout the development of pools, and the decades-long battle of African Americans achieving equal rights. This gave readers a newfound appreciation for both the good and the bad shaping, who we are as a people. Finally, Wiltse research has shown a need in the recreation field to rebuild a community mirroring the swimming culture of the 1920s, but with a nondiscriminatory approach. Informal social spaces, such as pools, town squares, and other recreation centers, have the potential to facilitate diversified relationships, ease social tensions, and break the bonds of discrimination. Contested Waters provides useful lessons to academics, students, and practitioners as they tackle the problems of community, making our cities more livable, and ensuring that public places are inviting and welcoming to all Americans.

	abstract = {We present a simple graphical theory unifying causal directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) and potential (aka counterfactual) outcomes via a node-splitting
transformation. We introduce a new graph, the Single-World Intervention
Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on the set of treatment
variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual
random variables. We illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Our
graphical theory of SWIGs may be used to infer the counterfactual independence relations implied by the counterfactual models developed in Robins
(1986, 1987). Moreover, in the absence of hidden variables, the joint distribution of the counterfactuals is identified; the identifying formula is the
extended g-computation formula introduced in (Robins et al., 2004). Although Robins (1986, 1987) did not use DAGs we translate his algebraic
results to facilitate understanding of this prior work. An attractive feature
of Robins’ approach is that it largely avoids making counterfactual independence assumptions that are experimentally untestable. As an important
illustration we revisit the critique of Robins’ g-computation given in (Pearl,
2009, Ch. 11.3.7); we use SWIGs to show that all of Pearl’s claims are either
erroneous or based on misconceptions.
We also show that simple extensions of the formalism may be used to
accommodate dynamic regimes, and to formulate non-parametric structural
equation models in which assumptions relating to the absence of direct effects are formulated at the population level. Finally, we show that our
graphical theory also naturally arises in the context of an expanded causal
Bayesian network in which we are able to observe the natural state of a
variable prior to intervention.},

Such problems include analyses of path-specific effects and dynamic treatment regimes. In this paper we present the potential outcome calculus (po-calculus), a natural generalization of do-calculus for arbitrary potential outcomes. We thereby provide a bridge between identification approaches which have their origins in artificial intelligence and statistics, respectively. We use po-calculus to give a complete identification algorithm for conditional path-specific effects with applications to problems in mediation analysis and algorithmic fairness.},

The author develops the first evidence on the degree to which labor unions develop members' political leadership in the broader community by studying the relationship between state legislators' occupations and the unionization rates of occupations across U.S. states. The fraction of legislators of a given occupation in a state increases with the occupation's rate of unionization in that state compared with the fraction of legislators of the same occupation in other states with lower unionization rates. This pattern shows up to varying degrees among the three public-sector and one private-sector occupations considered: K-12 teachers, police officers, firefighters, and construction workers. The pattern holds conditional on differences in observable state characteristics and when using state fixed effects. Although much research has described the role of unions in influencing economic outcomes and in politics through lobbying, campaign contributions, and voter mobilization, the author adds a new perspective on the role of unions in society. They promote elected political leadership by individuals from working- and middle-class jobs. Arguments over the social value of this role of unions are explored.},

Nevertheless, vulnerable workers still do not trust government to come forward and report labor law violations. The article argues that while increasing the size of the labor inspectorate and engaging in strategic enforcement are necessary, they are not sufficient. It argues that co-enforcement, in which government partners with organizations that have industry expertise and relationships with vulnerable workers, has the potential to manage the shifting and decentralized structures of twenty-first-century production, which were explicitly designed to evade twentieth-century laws and enforcement capabilities. The article aims to contribute to a broader understanding of the role of organizations in enforcement and the circumstances in which their effectiveness can be maximized. It sets forth a set of scope conditions and mechanisms and examines empirical cases of co-enforcement in Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The main findings are that co-enforcement is most enduring when (1) government agencies and worker organizations recognize each other’s unique capacities, rather than attempt to substitute for one another (2); the effort focuses on a specific industry; and (3) the collaboration receives strong political support. Sustaining the impacts of co-enforcement is found to require greater formalization of the partnership and funding streams.},

	abstract = {The two main axes of inequality in the U.S. labor market—occupation and workplace—have increasingly consolidated. In 1999, the largest share of employment at high-paying workplaces was blue-collar production workers, but by 2017 it was managers and professionals. As such, workers benefiting from a high-paying workplace are increasingly those who already benefit from membership in a high-paying occupation. Drawing on occupation-by-workplace data, we show that up to two-thirds of the rise in wage inequality since 1999 can be accounted for not by occupation or workplace inequality alone, but by this increased consolidation. Consolidation is not primarily due to outsourcing or to occupations shifting across a fixed set of workplaces. Instead, consolidation has resulted from new bases of workplace pay premiums. Workplace premiums associated with teams of professionals have increased, while premiums for previously high-paid blue-collar workers have been cut. Yet the largest source of consolidation is bifurcation in the social sector, whereby some previously low-paying but high-professional share workplaces, like hospitals and schools, have deskilled their jobs, while others have raised pay. Broadly, the results demonstrate an understudied way that organizations affect wage inequality: not by directly increasing variability in workplace or occupation premiums, but by consolidating these two sources of inequality.},

	abstract = {This paper provides evidence from the US and Denmark that managers with a business degree (“business managers”) reduce their employees' wages. Within five years of the appointment of a business manager, wages decline by 6\% and the labor share by 5 percentage points in the US, and by 3\% and 3 percentage points in Denmark. Firms appointing business managers are not on differential trends and do not enjoy higher output, investment, or employment growth thereafter. Using manager retirements and deaths and an IV strategy based on the diffusion of the practice of appointing business managers within industry, region and size quartile cells, we provide additional evidence that these are causal effects. We establish that the proximate cause of these (relative) wage effects are changes in rent-sharing practices following the appointment of business managers. Exploiting exogenous export demand shocks, we show that non-business managers share profits with their workers, whereas business managers do not. But consistent with our first set of results, these business managers show no greater ability to increase sales or profits in response to exporting opportunities. Finally, we use the influence of role models on college major choice to instrument for the decision to enroll in a business degree in Denmark and show that our estimates correspond to causal effects of practices and values acquired in business education - rather than the differential selection into business education of individuals unlikely to share rents with workers.},

	abstract = {Since the Webbs published Industrial Democracy at the end of the nineteenth century, the principle that workers have a legitimate voice in decision-making in the world of work – in some versions through trade unions, in others at least formally through separate representative structures – has become widely accepted in most West European countries. There is now a vast literature on the strengths and weaknesses of such mechanisms, and we review briefly some of the key interpretations of the rise (and fall) of policies and structures for workplace and board-level representation. We also discuss the mainly failed attempts to establish broader processes of economic democracy, which the eclipse of nationally specific mechanisms of class compromise makes again a salient demand. Economic globalization also highlights the need for transnational mechanisms to achieve worker voice (or more radically, control) in the dynamics of capital–labour relations. We therefore examine the role of trade unions in coordinating pressure for a countervailing force at European and global levels, and in the construction of (emergent?) supranational industrial relations. However, many would argue that unions cannot win legitimacy as a democratizing force unless manifestly democratic internally. Therefore we revisit debates on and dilemmas of democracy within trade unions, and examine recent initiatives to enhance democratization.},

	abstract = {King and Roberts (2015, KR) claim that a disagreement between robust and classical standard errors exposes model misspeciﬁcation. We emphasize that KR’s claim only generally applies to parametric models: models that assume a restrictive form of the distribution of the outcome. Many common models in use in political science, including the linear model, are not necessarily parametric – rather they may be semiparametric. Common estimators of model parameters such as ordinary least squares have both robust (corresponding to a semiparametric model) and classical (corresponding to a more restrictive model) standard error estimates. Given a properly speciﬁed semiparametric model and mild regularity conditions, the classical standard errors are not generally consistent, but the robust standard errors are. To illustrate this point, we consider the case of the regression estimate of a semiparametric linear model with no model misspeciﬁcation, and show that robust standard errors may nevertheless systematically differ from classical standard errors. We show that a disagreement between robust and classical standard errors is not generally suitable as a diagnostic for regression estimators, and that KR’s reanalyses of Neumayer (2003) and Bu¨the and Milner (2008) are predicated on strong assumptions that the original authors did not invoke nor require.},

	abstract = {This survey discusses recent developments in the growing literature on the Russian economic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. Using novel data and modern empirical methods, this research generates new insights and provides important lessons for development economics and political economy. We organize the discussion around four strands of this literature. First, we summarize and put in comparative perspective research on the long-term trends in economic development and living standards, which shows that throughout history Russia significantly underperformed advanced economies. We also compile reliable quantifications of the human cost of Stalin's dictatorship. Second, we discuss new studies of imperial Russia that partially confirm Gerschenkron's classic conjecture on the institutional explanation for Russia's relatively low level of economic development and on the causes of the revolution. The third strand of the literature focuses on the Soviet period and explains its slowdown over time and the eventual collapse of the system by the command economy's inability to provide incentives to individual agents. The fourth strand documents the long-term economic, social, and political consequences of large-scale historical experiments that took place during both the imperial and the Soviet periods. We conclude by discussing the lessons from these four strands of the literature and highlight open questions for future research.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 accelerated a decade-long shift to remote work by normalizing working from home on a large scale. Indeed, 75\% of US employees in a 2021 survey reported a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week1, and studies estimate that 20\% of US workdays will take place at home after the pandemic ends2. Here we examine how this shift away from in-person interaction affects innovation, which relies on collaborative idea generation as the foundation of commercial and scientific progress3. In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas. By contrast, when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that videoconferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups. Departing from previous theories that focus on how oral and written technologies limit the synchronicity and extent of information exchanged4–6, we find that our effects are driven by differences in the physical nature of videoconferencing and in-person interactions. Specifically, using eye-gaze and recall measures, as well as latent semantic analysis, we demonstrate that videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus. Our results suggest that virtual interaction comes with a cognitive cost for creative idea generation.},

We provide a general experimental method, which can be used across platforms and time, for numerically quantifying the intensity with which platform workers experience reputation system-based algorithmic management. Our method works via an experiment where workers choose between a monetary bonus or a positive review. We demonstrate this method by measuring the value that freelancers assigned to positive feedback on Upwork in June 2020. The median freelancer in our sample valued a single positive review at ∼ \$49 USD. We also find that less experienced freelancers valued a positive review more highly than those with more experience. Qualitative data collected during the experiment indicates that many freelancers considered issues related to reputation system-based algorithmic management while choosing between the monetary reward and the positive review.},
